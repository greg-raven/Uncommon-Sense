We need true tax reform that will at least make a start toward restoring for our children the American Dream that wealth is denied to no one, that each individual has the right to fly as high as his strength and ability will take him â€¦ But we cannot have such reform while our tax policy is engineered by people who view the tax as a means of achieving changes in our social structure.
