Let me say it bluntly and without fear: Obama, Holder and all their ideological clones – white, brown or black – are nothing more than racialist one-trick ponies. They have no desire to end racism in America – if such a feat were even possible. Their desire is to perpetuate racism for their own political empowerment.
