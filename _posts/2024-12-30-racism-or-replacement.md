Over the weekend I sent out a simple post that started a firestorm. The context of when I sent this post is important, so let's start there. Amidst a raging week long debate about immigration all over the Internet, people who were arguing in favor of hiring Americans over foreign H-1B workers were being called "racists," myself included.

Words like "racism" have been so grossly misused and abused over the past few decades that they have lost all real meaning. They have become nothing more than weapons of political correctness, used to silence and demonize anyone who dares to dissent from the prevailing leftist orthodoxy. The term "racism" has also been specifically weaponized against White people. In its contemporary usage, "racism" is essentially synonymous with in-group preference.

Every other race and ethnic group on the planet engages in in-group preference, favoring their own kind in various aspects of life such as employment, neighborhoods, social circles, mate selection, and yesâ€”even the church they attend. One of my favorite clips to illustrate this is the infamous Muhammad Ali "Blue birds fly with blue birds" interview.

And there is nothing wrong with this, I have no problem with other races having an in-group preference. This was the norm for every racial group for all of human history until about five minutes ago, when Whites decided to embrace suicidal levels of altruism and atomized individualism. This self-destructive behavior, if not addressed, will have long-lasting effects on the future of the White race and thus Western civilization itself. We simply cannot afford to be afraid to state this obvious fact out loud anymore.

My main problem is with the double standard.

When Jewish, Black, Hispanic, or Asian organization lobby for policies that benefit their communities, that is not considered "racist" by any stretch of the imagination by our society, but when Whites exhibit the same in-group preference, they are labeled as "racists" or "White supremacists." This distortion of the term "racism" is deeply deceptive. It implies that Whites having in-group preference is inherently malicious and irrational, driven solely by a hatred of other races.

This is a gross mischaracterization. In-group preference does not necessitate a venomous animosity towards other races simply because of their ancestry. It is a natural human tendency that has served to maintain the integrity and cohesion of various communities throughout time.

Even in the supposedly "enlightened" cities of the West, we see clear examples of in-group preference and ethnic enclaves. Neighborhoods like Chinatown, Little Italy, and others are designated areas where people of a particular ethnic or cultural background tend to congregate and live together.

There is nothing inherently wrong or "racist" about this. In fact, it is a completely natural and understandable human tendency. People often feel more comfortable and at home among those who share their language, culture, and traditions. Ironically, this is especially true for immigrant communities who may feel alienated and out of place in a predominantly foreign environment.

The existence of ethnic enclaves and nations is a simple fact of life that we should accept and embrace, not demonize and pathologize. It is a reminder that, despite all our attempts to create a "colorblind" society, human beings are inherently tribal creatures who will always be drawn to those who are most like themselves.

The true significance of in-group preference lies in its role as a mechanism for survival and prosperity. When Whites fail to prioritize their own group interests, they leave themselves vulnerable to displacement, replacement, and eventual destruction at the hands of other groups that have no qualms about pursuing their own self-interests.

It is essential for Whites to recognize and understand the importance of in-group preference, not to foster hate or animosity towards other races, but to ensure the continued survival and flourishing of our people and nations. We can, should, and have every right to embrace and advocate for our own interests.

[T]here are real differences between Christians and non-believers, as well as between different nations, cultures, and people groups. These differences are not accidental, but are part of God's plan and design for the world. Pretending that these differences can somehow be erased in the earthly realm is the folly of the egalitarian worldview. Standing idly by while God's enemies seek to destroy these differences in favor of a uniform, utopian sameness is not acceptable.

As one example of the very real differences --- even between Christians --- in the civil sphere, the voting patterns of evangelical Christians in the United States exhibit a significant racial divide. While White evangelicals have consistently shown strong allegiance to the Republican Party, with approximately 85% identifying as or leaning toward Republicans, the voting behavior of Black evangelical Christians is markedly different. Historically Black Protestant denominations, which often share similar theological characteristics, overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates. In recent elections, upwards of 80-90% of Black Protestant voters have cast their ballots for Democratic candidates.

This can also be observed by the fact that majority Black, Asian, Hispanic, and White churches exist. [...]

My post is not a call for hatred or division, but rather a call for White people to engage in self-preservation and the pursuit of a prosperous future for their own, like everyone else. So make the choice, and it is absolutely a binary choice --- you can be "racist" or you can be replaced by those who are.
