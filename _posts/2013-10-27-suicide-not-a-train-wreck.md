The GOP needs to stop calling Obamacare a ‘train wreck.’ That means it’s a mistake or accident. That means it’s a gigantic flop or failure. It’s not. This is a brilliant and purposeful attempt to damage the U.S. economy, kill jobs and bring down capitalism. It’s not a failure; it’s Obama’s grand success. It’s not a train wreck; Obamacare is a suicide attack.
