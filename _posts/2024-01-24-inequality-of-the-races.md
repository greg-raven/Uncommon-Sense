If we insist races are equal, every black shortcoming has to be blamed on white supremacy, the legacy of slavery, white privilege, systemic racism, or whatever name we give to the latest explanation that denies reality. It's all the fault of white people. Blaming whites does two things:

It teaches blacks to hate us --- and boy, do they.

It also manipulates guilty whites into supporting "diversity, equity, and inclusion," which means taking from whites and giving to blacks. Equal outcomes are not possible, so DEI will never end. We are turning our country inside out --- weakening it terribly.
