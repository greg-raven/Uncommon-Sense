Government isn’t a good way to solve problems ... \[G\]overnment is concerned mostly with self-perpetuation and is subject to fantastic ideas about its own capabilities. ... \[G\]overnment is wasteful of the nation’s resources, immune to common sense and subject to pressure from every half-organized bouquet of assholes. ... \[G\]overnment is distrustful of and disrespectful toward average Americans while being easily gulled by Americans with money, influence, or fame.
