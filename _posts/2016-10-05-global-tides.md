Republicans refuse to understand that not all rising tides lift all boats. There are ways the rich can do well while most of the country does worse. The globalization of our economy means that the very rich get a much bigger share of a much smaller pie. When jobs are outsourced or given to illegal aliens, the employer is better off. Mexicans are better off --- theyâ€™re making $3 an hour instead of $1 an hour. But most Americans are massively worse off.
