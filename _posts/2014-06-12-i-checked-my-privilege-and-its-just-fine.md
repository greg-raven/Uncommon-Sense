The plain fact is that what \[liberals\] understand to be ’privilege’ is really just what regular people understand is a ‘consequence.’ It is a consequence of hard work, of delaying gratification, and of sacrifice. No one came and bestowed this country upon us. We built it. Some of us died doing so. If we have privilege, it was earned at Bunker Hill, Gettysburg, and Normandy. It’s not a function of skin tone or the number of vowels in your name; it’s a function of character.

Their poisonous notion of privilege is really just another way for liberals to pick winners and losers based not upon who has won or lost in the real world, but upon who is useful and not useful to the progressive project at any given moment.
