If you want a conservative country, you need a conservative populace. Immigration is changing the country, and there will be no changing it back. If you don’t understand that, you are the enemy of any conservative undertaking.

There’s no question but that the country is heading toward being Brazil. One doesn’t have to agree with the reason to see that the very rich have gotten much richer, placing them well beyond the concerns of ordinary people, and the middle class is disappearing. America doesn’t make anything anymore, except Hollywood movies and Facebook. At the same time, we’re importing a huge peasant class, which is impoverishing what remains of the middle class, whose taxes support cheap labor for the rich.
