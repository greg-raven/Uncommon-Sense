As far as I can tell, globalism is a scheme concocted by the rich to destroy the working and middle classes through worldwide financial imperialism.  
  
I have a strong hunch that globalism is also a plot hatched to obliterate indigenous cultures and real human differences under the deceptive ruses of 'multiculturalism' and 'diversity.'

This is why I'm confused whenever I hear someone say they hate 'the rich,' oppose 'imperialism,' and support 'the working class' while being an unquestioning cheerleader for open borders and global government.

Those who constantly slam 'the rich' while naively embracing globalism and every attendant butterfly-chasing PC delusion fail to realize that almost without exception, global finance, global media, and global corporate culture are solidly behind this daffy, one-world movement of free trade, open borders, and PC thought-policing. The charitable foundations and the think tanks and the NGOs have all signed up for this mission that purportedly will uplift the masses and bring the rich to heel, yet very few people seem to find this even remotely suspicious. 'The rich' are backing a movement that superficially demonizes 'the rich' yet only makes them richer, but if you say anything about it, you're a Nazi.
