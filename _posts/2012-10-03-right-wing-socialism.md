The Big Lie of the late 20th century was that Nazism was Rightist. It was in fact typical of the Leftism of its day. It was only to the Right of Stalin’s Communism. The very word ‘Nazi’ is a German abbreviation for ‘National Socialist’ (Nationalsozialist) and the full name of Hitler’s political party (translated) was ‘The National Socialist German Workers’ Party’ (In German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei).
