The government of the absolute majority is but the government of the strongest interests; and when not effectively checked, is the most tyrannical and oppressive that can be devised ... \[To read the Constitution is to realize that\] no free system was ever farther removed from the principle that the absolute majority, without check or limitation, ought to govern.
