Americans find it intolerable that one constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order to assert another. America is the land of the free and home of the brave — we don’t need a Patriot Act, because we are already patriots. We know freedom means responsibility, but I am not sure Congress and its domestic enforcement agencies do. More often than not, new security measures enacted by the government have resulted in more violations of the citizenry than terrorists have ever done. The terrorists want us to be afraid — well, we are not afraid. Stop wasting dollars on this program — it is not good for America. To give up essential liberty for a little security provides neither. The right to be left alone from government intrusion is the beginning of all freedoms.
