The \[National Security Agency’s\] capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left, such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn’t matter. There would be no place to hide. \[If a dictator ever took over, the N.S.A.\] could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back.
