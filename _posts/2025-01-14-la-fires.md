The actual irony ... 

A home owner consents to pay property taxes that will go to the fire department. The funds are diverted to illegal immigrants because LA is a Sanctuary City. 

An illegal immigrant comes and sets your house on fire and the fire department doesn't have the resources to put it out. 

The home owner paid for their own destruction. 

On top of that, the government is so inept that the insurance companies won't insure houses here anymore, so the home owner is left with nothing.
