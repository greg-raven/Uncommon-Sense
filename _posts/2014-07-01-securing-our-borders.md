Getting control of our borders is a key national security challenge. America is the most powerful nation in the world and has the resources and ability to secure the border; it's a question of political will. For too long, politicians have looked the other way while immigration laws are ignored by presidents of both parties.

Real border security should not be held hostage by special interest groups pushing for some form of amnesty. There's no need to wait for comprehensive immigration reform to secure our border. We're a nation of laws and the time has come for the administration to enforce the law and ensure a safe, secure, and sovereign southern border.
