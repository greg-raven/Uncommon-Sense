The entire time it was processing immigrants from 1892 until 1954, Ellis Island received only 12 million immigrants. \[...\] There was no welfare, and certainly no welcoming committees of ethnic grievance groups.  
  
People weren't allowed to come to America and just hang out. \[...\]

\[...\] Now no one goes home, they go on welfare. Today's immigrants aren't coming here to breathe free, they're coming to live for free. Most of them wouldn't come at all if they had to survive in the work-or-die America \[...\]
