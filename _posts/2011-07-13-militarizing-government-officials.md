Some police chiefs for years have warned that we are 'militarizing' our nation's police. 'Smart bombs' are used to enter drug dens. Officers are clad in paramilitary garb including battle helmets. Armored 'urban' assault vehicles are tactically utilized on city streets. Cops are trained in military tactics. You cannot train officers in such a manner and then expect them to behave like 'Officer Friendly' ... The FBI is an investigatory agency. Originally, they weren't even armed. Why are lawyers and accountants being transformed into G.I. Joes? When such occurs we come dangerously close to establishing a National Police Force, something not intended by the framers of the U.S. Constitution.
