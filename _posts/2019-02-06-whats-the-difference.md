I’m not saying *The New York Times* is a CIA organ. I’m just saying I can’t tell the difference … In the same way, I don’t believe that American history textbooks are written in smoke-filled rooms by conspirators who are trying to indoctrinate American students. But what I am saying is, if that did happen, I think the textbooks would look exactly like the ones we already have.
