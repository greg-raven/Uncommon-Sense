America is not the natural state of the world. The natural state of the world is Darfur. The British Empire spread Anglo-Saxon culture around the globe — Protestant morals, individualism, and the rule of law. Most British colonies rejected those values. Only the ones populated by actual British people — America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand — managed to hold on to them and, as a result, prospered. The empire’s most successful experiment was the United States. Anyone who hesitates for a moment to recognize that some groups have it over other groups in producing free and prosperous nations has been brainwashed beyond reclamation.
