Collectivism is the doctrine that the social collective --- called society, the people, the state, etc. --- has rights, needs, or moral authority above and apart from the individuals who comprise it. We hear this idea continually championed in such familiar platitudes as "the needs of the people take precedence over the rights of the individual," "production for people, not profits," and "the common good." Collectivism often sounds humane because it stresses the importance of human needs. In reality, it is little more than a rationalization for sacrificing you and me to the desires of others.
