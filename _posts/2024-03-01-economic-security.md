Anyone who says that economic security is a human right, has been too much babied. While he babbles, other men are risking and losing their lives to protect him. They are fighting the sea, fighting the land, fighting disease and insects and weather and space and time, for him, while he chatters that all men have a right to security and that some pagan god --- Society, The State, The Government, The Commune --- must give it to them. Let the fighting men stop fighting this inhuman earth for one hour, and he will learn how much security there is.
