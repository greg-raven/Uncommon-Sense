… I suggest that the more the state intervenes in such situations, the more ‘necessary’ (on this view) it becomes, because positive altruism and voluntary cooperative behavior atrophy in the presence of the state and grow in its absence. Thus, again, the state exacerbates the conditions which are supposed to make it necessary. We might say that the state is like an addictive drug: The more of it we have, the more we ‘need’ it and the more we come to ‘depend’ on it.
