It’s much more taboo to talk about race differences in intelligence, but the evidence for differences is overwhelming. You don’t have to be an expert to understand this. For example, there is no black country anywhere in the world — whether in Africa or in the Caribbean, like Haiti — that isn’t poor. Are all those countries, despite their very different histories, victims of racism in exactly the same way?

Before Europeans or Arabs showed up in black Africa, no one there had invented the wheel or any kind of mechanical device or had domesticated an animal or figured out a calendar or built a two-story building.

There is some debate as to whether any blacks even had a written language. Many ancient peoples — Chinese, Arabs, Greeks — encountered black Africans. When they wrote about it, they often said blacks were unintelligent. I have never read of anyone who marveled at their intelligence.

Here’s another pattern: There are 13,800 school districts in the United States. I don’t know of a single one that doesn’t fit the pattern on standardized tests: Black students get the worst grades. Hispanics do better than blacks.

Whites do better than Hispanics. And Asians do best of all. Does every one of those 13,800 school districts practice exactly the same kind of oppression that keeps black down — and Hispanics down, but not quite so far down and — somehow — pushes Asians ahead of whites? Or is the more likely explanation that, on average, people of different races have different abilities?

You may think tests of any kind — especially IQ tests — are racist, but specialists overwhelmingly agree that they are not. This book, for example, published by Cambridge University press, is a collection of 20 chapters written by the most eminent people in the field of intelligence. Tests accurately measure the intelligence of people of all races. You are basically born with a certain level of intelligence. It’s also clear that, on average, Asians score higher than whites on every kind of test. In America, they make more money than whites, live longer, and have much lower crime rates. How does that happen if America is a white supremacist country?
