According to the Tax Foundation, the average American worker works 127 days of the year just to pay his taxes. That means that government owns 36 percent of the average American's outputâ€”which is more than feudal serfs owed the robber barons. That 36 percent is more than the average American spends on food, clothing, and housing. In other words, if it were not for taxes, the average American's living standard would at least double.
