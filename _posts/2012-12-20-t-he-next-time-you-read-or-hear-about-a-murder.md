The next time you read or hear about a murder victim, a rape victim, or an assault victim, I want you to preface it with the word "unarmed" so that murder victims become "unarmed murder victims;" this is especially true in rape. How many times have you read, "An unidentified woman, heavily armed with a semi-automatic weapon was raped by a man wielding a knife." No answer is necessary, right?
