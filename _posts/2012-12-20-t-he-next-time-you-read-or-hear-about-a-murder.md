\[T\]he next time you read or hear about a murder victim, a rape victim or an assault victim, I want you to preface it with the word ‘unarmed’ so that murder victims become ‘unarmed murder victims’; this is especially true in rape. How many times have you read, ‘An unidentified woman, heavily armed with a semi-automatic weapon was raped by a man wielding a knife.’ No answer is necessary, right?
