Unlike the experts and journalists whose deep study has led them to a sophisticated take on Russia (that flips back and forth with the politics of the moment), my position on Russia has been as unchanged as the Rock of Gibraltar, at least since the end of the Cold War. Coincidentally, it is exactly the  
same as my position on Taiwan, Haiti, Uganda, and North Korea.

It is this: Tens of millions of illegals are pouring across our border and must be stopped.
