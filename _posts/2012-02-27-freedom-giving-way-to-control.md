I believe that America is the greatest country in history and for good reasons, but America has been changing and not for the better. Our free society has been falling prey to a more repressive system with methods for the increased control of people. The return of groups and individuals to the controlling ideology of Imperialism and Marxism using the structures of Corporatism, Socialism, and Democracy. The result is that this nationâ€™s foundational principles based on the ideology of Liberty are now in danger of extinction.
