\[T\]he delegation of the government, in \[a republic\], to a small number of citizens elected by the rest â€¦ \[is\] to refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations.
