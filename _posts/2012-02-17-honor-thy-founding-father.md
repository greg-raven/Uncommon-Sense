Honor the vision of your founders, cleave to the most sublime Constitution devised by human intelligence. Don’t be the generation that cuts itself off from the wisdom of your fathers and disinherits your children. Never be afraid to speak to and for the soul of this nation, of which by good fortune and God’s grace you are privileged to be a part. God bless you, my friends, God bless America, and God bless the alliance of the free English speaking nations.
