Power always corrupts, and the power of government to tell people how to live their lives or to transfer money from those who earn it to others is always a temptation to corruption. Taxes and regulations reduce people’s incentive to produce wealth, and government transfer programs reduce people’s incentive to work, to save, and to help family and friends in case of sickness, disability, or retirement. … \[I\]t is nonetheless clear that government enterprises are less efficient, less innovative, and more wasteful than private firms. … \[C\]ompare what it’s like to call American Express versus the IRS to correct problems.
