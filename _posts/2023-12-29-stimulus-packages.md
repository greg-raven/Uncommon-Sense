A large number of people, certainly the majority of the political looter class, think the best way to deal with the rapidly deepening economic crisis is via "stimulus packages" with money plucked off the magic money tree ... which is to say, by trying to re-inflate the credit bubble that actually caused the crisis. This is a bit like treating alcoholics by urging them to buy more whiskey.
