Gentle reminder that ISIS was created by the U.S. govt to fight the Shiite militants, who were armed by the U.S. government to fight Saddam, who was armed by the U.S. government to fight Iran, which hates us because the U.S. government overthrew their elected leader and installed a brutal dictator.
