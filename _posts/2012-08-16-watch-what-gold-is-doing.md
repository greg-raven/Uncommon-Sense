\[W\]hen I used to trade and Mr. Volcker was Fed chairman, he said something like "gold is my enemy, I'm always watching what gold is doing," we need to think why he made a statement like that. If you're a central banker or one of the congressmen or senators, watch what gold is doing because this is a no-confidence vote in fiscal and dollar policy.
