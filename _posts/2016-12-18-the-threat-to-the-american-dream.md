Most of us think the American Dream is a birthright, but I’ve been around long enough to realize that, without constant care and vigilance, it can and will be whittle down to nothing. The threatening agent is not some foreign power, but people who don’t understand the proper relationship between the public and private arenas. In other words, the greatest threat to the American Dream is the idea that dreamers need close government scrutiny and control. Job one for us is to make sure the public sector does a limited job, and no more.
