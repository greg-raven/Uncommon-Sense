Repeal that \[welfare\] law, and you will soon see a change in their manners. \[I\]ndustry will increase, and with it plenty among the lower people; their circumstances will mend, and more will be done for their happiness by inuring them to provide for themselves, than could be done by dividing all your estates among them.
