If a state militia guarantee rather than an individual right of citizens to keep and bear arms were the purpose of the Second Amendment, it would have been totally unnecessary and irrelevant to include any guarantee of ‘the right of the people to keep and bear arms,’ since by its very nature a militia is necessarily an armed force and without arms it would be impossible to carry out its constitutional functions of suppressing insurrections and repelling invasions.
