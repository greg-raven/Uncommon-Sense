Your children's children will live under communism. You Americans are so gullible. No, you won't accept Communism outright, but we'll keep feeding you small doses of Socialism until you will finally wake up and find that you already have Communism. We won't have to fight you; We'll so weaken your economy, until you fall like overripe fruit into our hands.
