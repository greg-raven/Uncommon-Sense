New York Times writer Nicholas Kristof asserts that there is 'overwhelming evidence that centuries of racial subjugation still shape inequity in the 21st century' and he mentions 'the lingering effects of slavery.' If we wanted to be serious about evidence, we might compare where blacks stood a hundred years after the end of slavery with where they stood after 30 years of the liberal welfare state.
