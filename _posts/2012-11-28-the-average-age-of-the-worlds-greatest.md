The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been two hundred years. These nations have progressed through this sequence:

- From bondage to spiritual faith;
- from spiritual faith to great courage;
- from courage to liberty;
- from liberty to abundance;
- from abundance to selfishness;
- from selfishness to complacency;
- from complaceny to apathy;
- from apathy to dependence;
- from dependency back again into bondage.
