This leftist political strategy to win office and power relies on something very powerful: The desire to increase the number of Americans who are dependent on getting money that is taken from other citizens. Sadly, this strategy has worked for half a century. And now it works because Americans who are trapped in this nightmare do not want their government money taken away from them.
