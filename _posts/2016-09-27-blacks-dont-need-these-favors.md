Many successful political careers have been built on giving blacks 'favors' that look good on the surface but do lasting damage in the long run. One of these 'favors' was the welfare state. A vastly expanded welfare state in the 1960s destroyed the black family, which had survived centuries of slavery and generations of racial oppression.

A big 'favor' the Obama administration is offering blacks today is exemption from school behavior rules that have led to a rate of disciplining of black male students that is greater than the rate of disciplining of other categories of students.
