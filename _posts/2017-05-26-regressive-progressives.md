The West is not perfect. We have our share of problems. But our flourishing civilizations, technological advancement, and (relative) peace are proof that we have done some things right. We must continue to insist upon a system that adequately screens potential immigrants, and then insist that they adopt our ways. No one can call himself or herself a 'progressive' if they are unwilling to characterize Western civilization as 'progress' in the advancement of human civilization.
