The judiciary of the United States is the subtle corps of sappers and miners constantly working under ground to undermine the foundations of our confederated fabric. They are construing our constitution from a coordination of a general and special government to a general and supreme one alone. This will lay all things at their feet … We shall see if they are bold enough to take the daring stride their five lawyers have lately taken. If they do, then … I will say, that “against this every man should raise his voice,” and more, should uplift his arm.
