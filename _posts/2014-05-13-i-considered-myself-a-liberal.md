I considered myself a liberal back when it seemed to have something to do with open-mindedness and skepticism, but that choo-choo train roared out of the station long ago. As the doctrine has gained steam over the years, it has morphed into a psycho-totalitarian power machine that brooks no dissent and ruthlessly scapegoats all nonbelievers. I abandoned egalitarianism not only when it became evident that it was a goofy, fraudulent, and ultimately destructive premise — I wiped it off my shoe when its adherents began acting more and more like religious fanatics.
