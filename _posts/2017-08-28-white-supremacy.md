We are led to believe that race doesn’t exist — which would imply that white people don’t exist, either—but that through some sort of socially righteous prestidigitation, white people are easy to spot and must be scapegoated for all human, animal, and plant suffering across the universe from the dawn of time. And if you think that’s a ridiculous burden to bear, that’s only because you’re a ‘white supremacist.’  
  
For about a quarter-century, I’ve been accused of being a ‘white supremacist’ for no other apparent reason than the fact that I don’t apologize for my skin color and don’t feel one sliver of guilt for history. I’ve never felt the need to say that white people are the best on Earth, but this isn’t what gets me labeled a white supremacist — it’s my refusal to say they’re the worst group on Earth.
