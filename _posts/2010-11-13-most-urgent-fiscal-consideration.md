No pecuniary consideration is more urgent, than the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt: On none can delay be more injurious, or an economy of time more valuable ... Cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible: avoiding occasions of expence \[and\] avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt ... not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burthen which we ourselves ought to bear.
