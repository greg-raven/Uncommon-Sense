\[T\]he need for the American citizenry to be well armed has never been greater …  
  
\[I\]t is clear that the U.S. law-enforcement system at all levels cannot protect Americans. The governing elite’s decades of pro-criminal laws; the legislative and judicial bans that prevent police to profile the suspicious and dangerous; our open borders and the elite’s refusal to enforce immigration laws; the national government’s cultivation of intensifying international hatred with unnecessary interventionist wars; the mainstream media’s complete failure to report the increasing numbers of murders and other major crimes that destroy the myth of a multicultural-diversity-unlimited-immigration route to utopia, all of which have combined to make law enforcement’s job an impossibility. Americans are going to have help the police if they are to be defended, and may well have to do so alone if politicians keep ordering the police to stand down when the left riots.
