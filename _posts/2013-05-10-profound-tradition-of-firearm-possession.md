We may be thankful that frightened civil authorities … have not managed to eradicate from the country the tradition of the possession and use of firearms, that profound and almost instinctive tradition of Americans. Luckily for us, our tradition of bearing arms has not gone from the country, the tradition is so deep and so dear to us that it is one of the most treasured parts of the Bill of Rights — the right of all Americans to bear arms, with the implication that they will know how to use them.
