Our founding fathers detested the idea of a democracy and labored long to prevent America becoming one. Once again — the word ‘democracy’ does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, or the constitution of any of the fifty states. Not once. Furthermore, take a look at State of the Union speeches. You won’t find the ‘D’ word uttered once until the Wilson years.
