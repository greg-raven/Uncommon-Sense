You can’t save free markets by socialism, I don’t know where this idea ever came from. You save free markets by promoting free markets and sound money and balanced budgets.  
   
The whole reason why nobody wants to address the real problem is, we’re spending a trillion dollars a year overseas running an empire, and it’s coming to an end. This country is bankrupt, and we won’t admit it. Eventually though, the dollar will go bust, and we will bring our troops home, and we will live within our means, but we ought to do it sensibly, rather than waiting for the collapse of the dollar, and this is what we’re doing, we’re on the verge of destroying our dollar. And then, you think we have problems now, problems then will be a lot worse, it’d look like the Weimar Republic, or a third world nation. And a lot of people know that, and they’re scared to death, but we don’t need to be making the problem worse by just propping up everything with more government programs, more inflation, and more helicopters, it won’t work.
