The real reason to abolish departments like Energy and Education is not to promote efficiency, nor even to save taxpayersâ€™ money. It is that many agencies perform functions that are not Federal responsibility. The founders delegated to the Government only strictly defined authority in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution. Search the entire Constitution, and you will find no authorization for Congress to subsidize the arts, finance and regulate education, or invest tax revenues in energy research.
