1. Revoke the CITIZENSHIP of anyone living in the so-called autonomous zone.
2. Set up a perimeter around their declared border, complete with concertina wire, armed border patrol agents, and CHECKPOINTS. At these checkpoints, post signs saying, “You are now entering the United States of America. Please have passports and travel papers ready.” Deny entry to anyone who does not comply.
3. CUT OFF their electricity, water, land-line, and sewer systems. If they are autonomous, they must supply their own infrastructure or purchase it from America at market rates.
4. Place TARIFFS on any goods they wish to export from their autonomous zone, same as you would with any other country.
5. Set their CELL SERVICE to international rates.
6. If they wish to return to the United States, they must APPLY for IMMIGRATION, just like any other foreigner would. If they sneak into the country, put them into detention centers, then deport them back to CHAZ.
7. Sit back and laugh when they start realizing the real world isn’t like playing Sims in mommy’s basement.
