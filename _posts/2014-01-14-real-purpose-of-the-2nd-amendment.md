Before you jump on the emotionally-charged bandwagon for gun-control, take a moment to reflect on the real purpose of the Second Amendment, the right of the people to take up arms in defense of themselves, their families, and property in the face of invading armies or an oppressive government.

The argument that the Second Amendment only applies to hunting and target shooting is asinine. When the United States Constitution was drafted, 'hunting' was an everyday chore carried out by men and women to put meat on the table each night, and 'target shooting' was an unheard of concept. Musket balls were a precious commodity and were certainly not wasted on 'target shooting.' The Second Amendment was written by people who fled oppressive and tyrannical regimes in Europe, and it refers to the right of American citizens to be armed for defensive purposes, should such tyranny arise in the United States.

If liberals had a decent argument for taking guns away from the law-abiding while doing nothing to prevent schizophrenics from getting guns, they'd make it. Manifestly, they don't, so they send out victims to make the argument for them, knowing no one will argue with a person whose child has just been murdered.
