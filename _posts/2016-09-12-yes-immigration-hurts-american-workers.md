... anyone who tells you that immigration doesn't have any negative effects doesn't understand how it really works. When the supply of workers goes up, the price that firms have to pay to hire workers goes down.

Somebody's lower wage is always somebody else's higher profit.

The fiscal burden offsets the gain from the $50 billion immigration surplus, so it's not too farfetched to conclude that immigration has barely affected the total wealth of natives at all. Instead, it has changed how the pie is split, with the losers --- the workers who compete with immigrants, many of those being low-skilled Americans --- sending a roughly $500 billion check annually to the winners.
