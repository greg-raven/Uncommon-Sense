I would like to call upon America to be more careful with its trust … and prevent those … because of short-sightedness and still others out of self-interest, from falsely using the struggle for peace and for social justice to lead you down a false road. Because they are trying to weaken you; they are trying to disarm your strong and magnificent country in the face of this fearful threat. … I call upon you: ordinary working men of America … do not let yourselves become weak.
