If the purpose of immigration policy were to amass wealth for very few Americans at top incomes and provide employment to people from other countries, then it's working. But if the purpose of immigration policy, such as all other public policies, were to benefit the majority of Americans, then it's not working. \[...\] The majority of Americans receive little economic benefit from immigration, and the savings from reduced wages travels upward to employers and investors. In short, immigration is predominantly a massive income redistribution policy.
