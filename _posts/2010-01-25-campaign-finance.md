Certainly, the specter of corporate money buying candidates and influencing our political system is an unwholesome one. But the solution is not limiting campaign donations. It is limiting the power of government, so that there is nothing on which to spend money, and the money that is spent in the system has less impact on our lives, returning power to “the little guy” to whom politicians love to pay lip service.
