Muslims in large numbers do not belong in any Western society. It was a mistake to let them in, and now we have to recognize that mistake and find ways to start reversing that immigration.

If Islam is a nation, and they think of themselves as a nation, well the jihadists are the soldiers of this nation. And the regular members are the civilians … The civilians are not on the battlefield, they’re not waging war, but they are still part of the nation in whose name and on whose behalf the warriors are waging war.

Any activism which tries to deal with the symptoms of the problem but accepts the existence of the problem itself is ultimately in my view a losing game. If we accept the presence of Islam in the West we’re just going to be foot dragging as they gain more and more power.
