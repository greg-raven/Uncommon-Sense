Today, when a concerted effort is made to obliterate this point, it cannot be repeated too often that the Constitution is a limitation on the government, not on private individuals --- that it does not prescribe the conduct of private individuals, only the conduct of the government --- that it is not a charter *for* government power, but a charter of the citizen's protection *against* the government.
