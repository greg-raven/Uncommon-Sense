On every hand, the West is retrenching, retreating, collapsing, and imploding. We, whose forefathers gave us Christian morality, liberty, democracy, free markets, prosperity, learning, the age of reason and enlightenment, and the scientific method, are throwing all of these priceless advantages away.

These Western values came at a heavy price. We are letting them go for nothing.

Yet today's assaults on the West are not so much external as internal. Subversion from within is now more of a menace to our way of life than aggression from without.
