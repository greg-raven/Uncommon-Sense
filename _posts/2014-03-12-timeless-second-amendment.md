It’s an interesting position to suggest the 2nd Amendment should only protect the right to bear the arms in use when the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. Following this logic, the protections provided by the 1st Amendment must be similarly restricted to the technology of the time. Speech using radio or television or a blogger’s commentary or the Internet would not be protected by the 1st Amendment, since “what they had in mind” were quill pens, hand presses, and unamplified voices.
