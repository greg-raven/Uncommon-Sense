All you have to do, is to see whether the law takes from some what belongs to them in order to give it to others to whom it does not belong. We must see whether the law performs, for the profit of one citizen and to the detriment of others, an act which that citizen could not perform himself without being guilty of a crime. Repeal such a law without delay. … \[I\]f you don’t take care, what begins by being an exception tends to become general, to multiply itself, and to develop into a veritable system.
