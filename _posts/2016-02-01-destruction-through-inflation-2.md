Hundreds of thousands of rouble notes are being issued daily by our treasury. This is done, not in order to fill the coffers of the State with practically worthless paper, but with the deliberate intention of destroying the value of money as a means of payment ... Experience has taught us it is impossible to root out the evils of capitalism merely by confiscation and expropriation ... The simplest way to exterminate the very spirit of capitalism is therefore to flood the country with notes of a high face-value without financial guarantees of any sort ... \[T\]he great illusion of the value and power of money, on which the capitalist state is based, will have been definitely destroyed.
