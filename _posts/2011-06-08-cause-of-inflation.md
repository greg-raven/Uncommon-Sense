Inflation is not caused by the actions of private citizens, but by the government: by an artificial expansion of the money supply required to support deficit spending. No private embezzlers or bank robbers in history have ever plundered peopleâ€™s savings on a scale comparable to the plunder perpetrated by the fiscal policies of statist governments.
