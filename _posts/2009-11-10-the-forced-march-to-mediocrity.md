It becomes increasingly clear that the pattern of American fiscal policy is being brought into consonance with the Karl Marx communist theory that through a division of the existing wealth, mankind will be brought to a universal standard of life â€” a degree of mediocrity to which the Communists and their fellow travelers seek to reduce the people of this great nation. Whether it be by accident or design, such policy, formulated with reckless indifference to the preservation of constitutional liberty and our free-enterprise economy, coupled with rapid centralization of power in the hands of a few, is leading us toward a communist state with as dreadful certainty as though the leaders of the Kremlin themselves were charting our course.
