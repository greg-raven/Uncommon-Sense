This is MLK’s birthday, a national holiday. It is also the day when the Democrats’ blatant hypocrisy is raised to a new level. They use King’s memory to suck up to the useful idiots who are unaware they’re being sold a complete bill of goods. Every other day of the year they stand four-square against everything he stood for. Were he still alive he’d be treated like Justice Thomas, Senator Tim Scott, and every other black who has left the plantation.  
  
But for this one day they invoke his memory, spout platitudes, and preach about living his ‘dream,’ all while spouting hatred for anyone of the wrong color or ideology.
