You won’t get gun control by disarming law-abiding citizens. There’s only one way to get real gun control: Disarm the thugs and the criminals, lock them up and if you don’t actually throw away the key, at least lose it for a long time … it’s a nasty truth, but those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun controllers. I happen to know this from personal experience.
