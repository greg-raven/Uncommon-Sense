And then there’s the question of immigration. Of course, I can quite understand why the champagne socialists are worried about the plight of poor Ndjama. His village has been sacked by rebels, he has nowhere to live and nothing to eat. Of course they would want him to have a home in Britain. Fundamentally, they are good people with big hearts. But mostly they want Ndjama to come here because when he does, he’s not going to be living in their street.
