The mission of the law is not to oppress persons and plunder them of their property, even though the law may be acting in a philanthropic spirit. Its purpose is to protect persons and property ... If you exceed this proper limit --- if you attempt to make the law religious, fraternal, equalizing, philanthropic, industrial, or artistic --- you will then be lost in uncharted territory, in vagueness and uncertainty, in a forced utopia or, even worse, in a multitude of utopias, each striving to seize the law and impose it on you.
