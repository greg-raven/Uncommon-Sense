The American people will never knowingly adopt Socialism. But under the name of "liberalism," they will adopt every fragment of the Socialist program, until one day America will be a Socialist nation, without knowing how it happened.

\[Note: Norman Thomas and Gus Hall, the U.S. Communist Party Candidate, each quit American politics, agreeing that the Republican and Democratic parties had adopted every plank on the Communist/Socialist and they no longer had an alternate party platform on which to run.\]
