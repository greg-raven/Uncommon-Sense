The companion lie to the 'America is a nation of immigrants' lie is 'diversity is a strength.' Praising diversity is simply part of the PC dogma, a mantra constantly being pounded into our heads. \[...\] Contrary to everything you've heard, never in recorded history has diversity been anything but a disaster.

Look at Ireland with its Protestant and Catholic populations, Canada with its French and English populations, Israel with its Jewish and Palestinian populations. Or consider the warring factions in India, Sri Lanka, China, Iraq, Czechoslovakia (until it happily split up), the Balkans, and Chechnya. Also review the festering hotbeds of tribal warfare --- I mean the "beautiful mosaic' --- in Third World disasters like Afghanistan, Rwanda, and South Central LA. If diversity is their strength, I'd hate to see what their weakness is.
