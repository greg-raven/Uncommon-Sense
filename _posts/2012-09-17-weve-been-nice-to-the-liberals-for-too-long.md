Bill \[Clinton\] hates them \[refugees\] and fears them, especially the Cubans. Bill knows the Cubans are crazy. Only crazy people would flee from a country with free medical care, guaranteed employment for life, and first-rate gun control. The president and his sanctimonious twit of a wife have worked for decades to build a society like this, and here people are taking their lives in their hands to get away from it … Let’s face facts about our disgusting political opponents. We’ve been nice to the liberals for too long. They’re thugs. The liberal dream is to control people, to oppress and exploit them for some ‘higher’ goal. And how are the liberals ever going to be able to control people brave enough to sail to Florida in a rum carton?… A civilized society should no more tolerate the presence of a liberal than the presence of a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Indeed, it may be argued that liberalism is worse than the KKK, insofar as Klansman only hate some people while liberals hate them all.
