The idea of a democracy is universal equality; the idea of a Constitutional Republic is individual Liberty.

A democracy always degenerates into a dictatorship that promises government-guaranteed equality and security but delivers nothing but poverty and serfdom for the people that it robs and rules.

America was founded as a Constitutional Republic to safeguard the liberty of the people against the tyranny of democracy or a one-man dictatorship.

In this century, great strides have been made toward the goal of subverting our Republic toward a Democracy. The most tactical of subversions is the subversion of "language."

By calling our nation a democracy until people thoughtlessly accept the use of the term, the totalitarians have obscured the real meaning of our principles of government.
