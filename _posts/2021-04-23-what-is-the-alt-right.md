The Alt-Right is the rational response to the failure of American conservatism to conserve anything, the inability of libertarianism to promote liberty, and the descent of American liberalism into multiculturalism, social justice, and diversity. What I like about the Alt-Right is that it offers Western civilization a chance of survival that it will otherwise lack.

The Alt-Right is important because it is the only current political philosophy that is in harmony with science, history, and reality as we currently observe it.

It is neither intrinsically racist nor intrinsically white. It's certainly not white supremacist; the desire of the white Alt-Right to preserve their European nations is no more "supremacist" than the desire of Israelis to preserve their Jewish nation or the desire of the Japanese to preserve their Japanese nation. Regardless of what you think of nationalism, nationalism is neither racism nor white supremacy.
