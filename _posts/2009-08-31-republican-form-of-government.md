Convinced that the republican is the only form of government which is not eternally at open or secret war with the rights of mankind, my prayers &amp; efforts shall be cordially distributed to the support of that we have so happily established. It is indeed an animating thought that, while we are securing the rights of ourselves &amp; our posterity, we are pointing out the way to struggling nations who wish, like us, to emerge from their tyrannies also. Heaven help their struggles, and lead them, as it has done us, triumphantly throâ€™ them.
