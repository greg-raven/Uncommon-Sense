We live in a country where 60m+ people are going to vote for a dementia patient to be leader of the free world.

We live in a country where cities burn to the ground and no one does anything to stop it, in fact they defund the police and tell them to stand down.

We live in a culture where despite every major corporation openly promoting, endorsing, and funding a marxist revolution those against it continue to use their products and services.

We live in a culture where Netflix openly promotes pedophilia and the top show is “Lucifer,” but millions keep on paying the monthly subscription and watching.

We live in a culture where about 5 companies in Silicon Valley openly censor the President of the United States and his supporters for 5 years now — and according to studies 90% of people are aware of this, yet keep using those services anyway!
