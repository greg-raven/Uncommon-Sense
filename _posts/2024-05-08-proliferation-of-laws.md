Through the rapid proliferation of laws reaching every corner of human existence, "the government is manufacturing more criminals now than ever before." The list of illegal activities includes more minutiae than one would think possible. Beer-makers are barred from listing alcohol content on bottles, and liquor distilleries cannot advertise on TV. Filling one's own prairie pothole can land a property owner in jail, as can protecting private property from unlawful intruders. Placing handbills in neighbors' mailboxes is strictly prohibited, and attempting to sell nectarines of an improper size is a federal offense. Companies are no longer allowed to give salaried professionals partial days off without pay, and in Texas it is a crime to call oneself an interior designer without the government's permission. It is perhaps easier to recount all that remains legal than all that is now prohibited.
