Not only have our post-1965 immigration policies increased America's welfare, criminal, and terrorism caseloads, but now all Americans are being asked to give up their civil liberties to fulfill Teddy Kennedy's dream of bringing the entire Third World to live here in America. \[...\] The National Security Act of 1947, creating the CIA, expressly prohibited the agency from engaging in domestic operations. But now we have to spy on 'Americans' because of all the al-Awlakis, Tsarnaevs, and Zazis. We have created two huge problems where none existed before --- domestic terrorism and government spying --- all so the Democrats can win elections and Mark Zuckerberg can underpay his employees.
