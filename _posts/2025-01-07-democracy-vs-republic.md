In a democracy, the majority rules. If the majority decides they want your bike, they can take it.

In a republic, your bike is your property and you do not owe it to anyone. It cannot be taken against your will, by law.

America is a Constitutional Republic.

Therefore, the Constitution is the law by which we are supposed to be protected.
In a republic, the individual is protected *from* the majority, by Constitutional law.

A Constitutional Republic is what we were given. It is up to us to keep it.
