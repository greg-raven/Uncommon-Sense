You came here because you didn’t like it there, but now you want to change here to be like there. Those of us who created here like it the way it is, and most of us prefer it because it’s not like there. Please stop trying to make here like there. If you really like there that much, you should not have left there to come here, and you are invited to leave here and go back there as soon as humanly possible.
