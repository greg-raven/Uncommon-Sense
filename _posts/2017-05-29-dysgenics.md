Today, the welfare state is the most powerful force working to lower the genetic level of the population. Any system that forces the responsible and hard working to support unlimited procreation by the incompetent can only drag down the average. In this little book \[*War and the Breed*\], David Starr Jordan reminds us that war is even more ruthlessly dysgenic. The very best of a nation's men are cut down in battle, often before they have had even a single child.
