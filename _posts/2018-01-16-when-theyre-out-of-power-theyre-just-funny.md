Being a Democrat means you don’t need a conscience or a moral compass. You cater to the ignorant, the lazy, and the morally reprehensible. You blatantly lie to them. Most of them know it and they don’t care. They are motivated by greed, ignorance, and hate. You stand for nothing except enriching yourself at the expense of the law-abiding people of this country who work and pay the taxes you buy votes with.  
  
When they’re in power, like the dark days of the Obama reign of terror, they specialize in spreading misery to all quarters. Times like these, when they’re relegated to comic relief, they can display a particular pathos born of desperation to be relevant. They will return to the throne one day, but until then they’re just fun to watch.
