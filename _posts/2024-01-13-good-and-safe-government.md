The way to have good and safe government is not to trust it all to one, but to divide it among the many, distributing to everyone exactly the functions in which he is competent ...

- To let the National Government be entrusted with the defense of the nation, and its foreign and federal relations ...

- The State Governments with the Civil Rights, Laws, Police, and administration of what concerns the State generally.

- The Counties with the local concerns, and each ward direct the interests within itself.

It is by dividing and subdividing these Republics from the great national one down through all its subordinations until it ends in the administration of everyman's farm by himself, by placing under everyone what his own eye may superintend, that all will be done for the best.
