It is precisely this clinging to victimhood as a means of demonstrating one’s virtue and advancing one’s well-being that has led us into a society in which welfare and quotas are ‘civil rights,’ government handouts are ‘entitlements,’ and payment to girls having babies out of wedlock are ‘compassionate,’ while hard-working, ambitious people are ‘greedy,’ punishment of crime is ‘oppression,’ and an independent thinker who stands for courage and self-reliance is dismissed as an ‘Uncle Tom.’
