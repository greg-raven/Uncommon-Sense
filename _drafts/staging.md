Honey. what do you want to he when you grow up?
A threat to the New World Order.

Believe nothing merely because you have been told it. Do not believe what your teacher tells you merely out of respect for the teacher. But whatsoever, after due examination and analysis, you find to be kind, conducive to the good, the benefit, the welfare of all beings --- that doctrine believe and cling to, and take it as your guide. Buddha

The whole secret of existence is to have no fear. Never fear what will become of you, depend on no one. Only the moment you reject all help are you freed. Buddha

There are only two mistakes one can make along the road to truth; not going all the way, and not starting. Buddha

Our lack of constant awareness has also permitted us to accept definitions of freedom that are not necessarily consistent with the actuality of being free. Because we have learned to confuse the word with the reality the word seeks to describe, our vocabulary has become riddled with distorted and contradictory meanings smuggled into the language. Butler D. Shaffer

Every form of addiction is bad, no matter whether the narcotic be alcohol or morphine or idealism. Carl Jung

Rational argument can be conducted with some prospect of success only so long as the emotionality of a given situation does not exceed a certain critical degree. If the affective temperature rises above this level, the possibility of reason's having any effect ceases and its place is taken by slogans and chimerical wish fantasies. That is to say, a sort of collective possession results which rapidly develops into a psychic epidemic. Carl Jung

Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of confusion and bamboozle requires intelligence, vigilance, dedication and courage. But if we don't practice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us --- and we risk becoming a nation of suckers, up for grabs by the next charlatan who comes along. Carl Sagan

This combustible mixture of ignorance and power sooner or later is going to blow up in our faces. Carl Sagan

The new law will create inflation whenever the trusts want inflation ... they can unload the stocks on the people at high prices during the excitement and then bring on a panic and buy them back at low prices ... the day of reckoning is only a few years removed. Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr.

When the President signs this act \[Federal Reserve Act of 1913\], the invisible government by the money power --- proven to exist by the Monetary Trust Investigation --- will be legalized. The new law will create inflation whenever the trusts want inflation. From now on, depressions will be scientifically created. Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr.

We believe that human happiness requires freedom and that freedom requires limited government. Charles Alan Murray

In order to become the master, the politician poses as the servant. Charles de Gaulle

When we lose the right to be different, we lose the privilege to be free. Charles Evans Hughes

While democracy must have its organizations and controls, its vital breath is individual liberty. Charles Evans Hughes

Whenever you look at a piece of work and you think the fellow was crazy, then you want to pay some attention to that. One of you is likely to be, and you better find out which one it is. It makes an awful lot of difference. Charles F. Kettering

There are two freedoms --- the false, where a man is free to do what he likes; the true, where a man is free to do what he ought. Charles Kingsley

A reasonable action on the part of the majority is very rare, while the evidence of mob stupidity and brutality is overwhelming. The majority in power make laws for their own financial benefit, disregarding the interests of the minority, and when the weak minority, by adding to its numbers, becomes powerful, it, in turn, does the same thing; thus, by appealing to power to settle their conflicting interests, the conflict would go on forever. Charles T. Sprading

The deterioration of every government begins with the decay of the principles on which it was founded. Charles-Louis de Secondat

What orators lack in depth they make up for in length. Charles-Louis de Secondat

As I have stood in the crosshairs of those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable thoughts and speech are mandated. Charlton Heston

Laws control the lesser man. Right conduct controls the greater one. Chinese Proverb

Laws control the lesser man. Right conduct controls the greater one. Chinese Proverb

The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their right names. Chinese Proverb

The bottom line: The gender pay gap is simply the difference between the average earnings of all men and women working full-time. It does not account for differences in occupations, positions, education, job tenure, or hours worked per week. When such relevant factors are considered, the wage gap narrows to the point of vanishing. Christina Hoff Sommers

Much of what we hear about the plight of American women is false. Some faux facts have been repeated so often they are almost beyond the reach of critical analysis. Though they are baseless, these canards have become the foundation of Congressional debates, the inspiration for new legislation, and the focus of college programs. Christina Hoff Sommers

If you don't know that the Nazi party was Socialist and the Communist party is Socialist and the majority, if not all, the Democrats running for President are Socialist. Then you are not paying attention, and you need to. Chuck Woolery

You can only protect your liberties in this world by protecting the other man's freedom. You can only be free if I am free. Clarence S. Darrow

We must create out of the younger generation a generation of Communists. We must turn children, who can be shaped like wax, into real, good Communists ... We must remove the children from the crude influence of their families. We must take them over and, to speak frankly, nationalize them. From the first days of their lives they will be under the healthy influence of Communist children's nurseries and schools. There they will grow up to be real Communists. Communist Party Education Workers Congress

The lust for power, for dominating others, inflames the heart more than any other passion. Cornelius Tacitus

The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws. Cornelius Tacitus

... \[I\]t was the calculated 'shearing' of the public by the World-Money powers triggered by the planned sudden shortage of call money in the New York Market. Curtis Dall

Most of his thoughts, his political 'ammunition,' ... were carefully manufactured for him in advance by the CFR-One World Money group. Brilliantly ... he exploded that prepared 'ammunition' in the middle of an unsuspecting target, the American people --- and thus paid off and retained his internationalist political support. Curtis Dall

A free man is as jealous of his responsibilities as he is of his liberties. Cyril James

The big thieves hang the little ones. Czech Proverb

It's gotten to where defense attorneys in federal drug cases can do their clients about as much good as Dr. Kevorkian can do his --- quietly shepherd them through to the least painful end. Dan Baum American journalist, author

Unable to maintain their government-granted monopoly, the powerful railroad interests turned to government to do the regulating and price-fixing which they were unable to do themselves. In fact, the pressure that induced Congress to enact the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 did not come from reformers bemoaning abuses by the powerful railroad interests; it came from the railroad interests themselves, asking Congress to shield them against the harsh winds of competition. Dan Smoot

We must abandon the prevalent belief in the superior wisdom of the ignorant. Daniel Boorstin

If the Union was formed by accession of States then the Union may be dissolved by the secession of States. Daniel Webster


No government is respectable which is not just. Without unspotted purity of public faith, without sacred public principle, fidelity, and honor, no machinery of laws, can give dignity to political society. Daniel Webster

Of all contrivances for cheating the laboring classes of mankind, none has been more effective than that which deludes them with paper money. Daniel Webster

Mankind is at its best when it is most free. This will be clear if we grasp the principle of liberty. We must recall that the basic principle is freedom of choice, which saying many have on their lips but few in their minds. Dante Alighieri

The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism, but the theory of necessity on which it is based is false; for the government, within the Constitution, has all the powers granted to it, which are necessary to preserve its existence; as has been happily proved by the result of the great effort to throw off its just authority. David Davis

Vote Labor, and you build castles in the air. Vote Conservative, and you can live in them. David Frost

Nothing appears more surprising to those who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye, than the ease with which the many are governed by the few. David Hume

The case for a free society rests on individualism. ... Every form of totalitarianism has sought control over the minds of individuals, and has understood that it must first undermine the individual?s confidence in the validity of his own faculties. Remember O'Brien's speech to Winston Smith in Orwell's '1984'. David Kelley

The case for a free society rests on individualism. ...

Remember O'Brien's speech to Winston Smith in Orwell's '1984' David Kelley

Liberty is not merely a privilege to be conferred; it is a habit to be acquired. David Lloyd George

Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it. David Rockefeller

We must not permit our respect for the dead or our sympathy for the living to lead us into an act of injustice to the balance of the living. I will not attempt to prove that Congress has no power to appropriate this money as an act of charity. Every member upon this floor knows it. We have the right as individuals to give away as much of our own money as we please in charity; but as members of congress we have no right to appropriate a dollar of the public money. Davy Crockett

... The purpose of the 2nd Amendment is to guarantee the existence of state military forces that can serve as a counterweight to a standing federal army. Thus, it seems fair to say, the scope of any rights enjoyed by the states under the 2nd Amendment would be determined by the goal of preserving an independent military force not under direct federal control. Dennis Hennigan Director of Handgun Control, Inc.'s Legal Action Project

I've finally figured out what the term 'inequity' means in Critical Race Theory. It means 'lack of achievement'. Dinesh D'Souza

[G]overnment theft of private money and redistribution by a government elite is communism not democracy. ... Communism has already been tried for over 70 years, and it doesn't work because people work to support themselves, not their neighbors. When the rewards are confiscated and redistributed to others, people produce less or stop producing altogether. The quantity of 'goods in common' declines until the system finally collapses and everybody is hungry, not just 'the poor.' Then totalitarianism steps in to force people to produce (ask the Russians, the Poles, the Estonians). Don Hull

You don't have to scratch liberalism very deeply to find socialism underneath, nor socialism to find authoritarianism underneath. Don Luskin

In every declining civilization there is a small 'remnant' of people who adhere to the right against the wrong; who recognize the difference between good and evil and who will take an active stand for the former and against the latter; who can still think and discern and who will courageously take a stand against the political, social, moral, and spiritual rot or decay of their day. Donald S. McAlvaney

The history of the welfare state is the history of public enterprise pushing out private organization. The impact was largely unintentional, but natural and inevitable. Higher taxes left individuals with less money to give; government's assumption of responsibility for providing welfare shriveled the perceived duty of individuals to respond to their neighbors' needs; and the availability of public programs gave recipients an alternative to private assistance, one which did not challenge recipients to reform their destructive behavior. Doug Bandow

Foreign aid might be defined as a transfer from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries. Douglas Casey

Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear --- kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervour --- with the cry of grave national emergency. Always, there has been some terrible evil at home, or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it. Douglas MacArthur

When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic. Dresden James

So long as we govern our nation by the letter and spirit of the Bill of Rights, we can be sure that our nation will grow in strength and wisdom and freedom. Harry S. Truman

The people's right to obtain information does not, of course, depend on any assured ability to understand its significance or use it wisely. Facts belong to the people simply because they relate to interests that are theirs, government that is theirs, and votes that they may desire to cast, for they are entitled to an active role in shaping every fundamental decision of state. Edmond Cahn

Example is the school of mankind, and they will learn at no other. Edmund Burke

Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites. Edmund Burke

Society cannot exist, unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere; and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things, that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters. Edmund Burke

The great inlet by which a colour for oppression has entered into the world is by one man's pretending to determine concerning the happiness of another. Edmund Burke

The greater the power the more dangerous the abuse. Edmund Burke

There is but one law for all, namely, that law which governs all law, the law of our Creator, the law of humanity, justice, equity --- the law of nature, and of nations. Edmund Burke

Toleration is good for all, or it is good for none. Edmund Burke

The general object was to produce a cure for the evils under which the United States labored; that in tracing these evils to their origins, every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy. Edmund Randolph

Personal liberty is the paramount essential to human dignity and human happiness. Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton

The Great Depression was not caused by laissez faire but by the actions of well-intended politicians and bureaucrats. The Federal Reserve System, after all, was not created in response to the Great Depression, but in 1913. Soon thereafter it began experimenting with its awesome powers, expanding the money supply during the roaring '20s, propping up the pound sterling in London, extending credit so Europeans could buy American agricultural products. All the while, Congress was becoming more and more protectionist. When the Fed reversed policies in 1929 and actually shrunk the money supply by a third over the next three years and Congress culminated its protectionist tendencies with the Smoot-Hawley tariff, the collapse was underway. The fact that Hoover then raised taxes and Roosevelt kept wages artificially high guaranteed the massive unemployment that marked the 1930s. Government caused and exacerbated the Great Depression. Edward H. Crane

Whenever the offence inspires less horror than the punishment, the rigour of penal law is obliged to give way to the common feelings of mankind. Edward Gibbon

A nation of sheep will soon have a government of wolves. Edward R. Murrow

The obscure we see eventually. The completely obvious, it seems, takes longer. Edward R. Murrow

We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. Edward R. Murrow

All change is not growth, as all movement is not forward. Ellen Glasgow

The republic was not established by cowards, and cowards will not preserve it. Elmer Davis

The Republic was not established by cowards; and cowards will not preserve it ... This will remain the land of the free only so long as it is the home of the brave. Elmer Davis

The individual is the true reality of life. A cosmos in himself, he does not exist for the State, nor for that abstraction called 'society,' or the 'nation,' which is only a collection of individuals. Emma Goldman

We must not believe the many, who say that only free people ought to be educated, but we should rather believe the philosophers who say that only the educated are free. Epictetus

Freedom is the greatest fruit of self-sufficiency. Epicurus

A ruling intelligentsia, whether in Europe, Asia or Africa, treats the masses as raw material to be experimented on, processed, and wasted at will. Eric Hoffer

It has often been said that power corrupts. But it is perhaps equally important to realize that weakness, too, corrupts. Power corrupts the few, while weakness corrupts the many. Hatred, malice, rudeness, intolerance, and suspicion are the faults of weakness. The resentment of the weak does not spring from any injustice done to them but from their sense of inadequacy and impotence. We cannot win the weak by sharing our wealth with them. They feel our generosity as oppression. Eric Hoffer

The basic test of freedom is perhaps less in what we are free to do than in what we are free not to do. Eric Hoffer

We clamour for equality chiefly in areas where we cannot ourselves hope to obtain excellence. Eric Hoffer

At least one way of measuring the freedom of any society is the amount of comedy that is permitted, and clearly a healthy society permits more satirical comment than a repressive, so that if comedy is to function in some way as a safety release then it must obviously deal with these taboo areas. This is part of the responsibility we accord our licensed jesters, that nothing be excused the searching light of comedy. If anything can survive the probe of humour it is clearly of value, and conversely all groups who claim immunity from laughter are claiming special privileges which should not be granted. Eric Idle

It is incredible how as soon as a people become subject, it promptly falls into such complete forgetfulness of its freedom that it can hardly be roused to the point of regaining it, obeying so easily and willingly that one is led to say that this people has not so much lost its liberty as won its enslavement. Estienne de la Boétie

The only thing that saves us from the bureaucracy is inefficiency. An efficient bureaucracy is the greatest threat to liberty. Eugene McCarthy

Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish. Euripides

If America is destroyed, it may be by Americans who salute the flag, sing the national anthem, march in patriotic parades, cheer Fourth of July speakers ? normally good Americans, but Americans who fail to comprehend what is required to keep our country strong and free, Americans who have been lulled away into a false security. Ezra Taft Benson

Freedom of expression is the well-spring of our civilization ... The history of civilization is in considerable measure the displacement of error which once held sway as official truth by beliefs which in turn have yielded to other truths. Therefore the liberty of man to search for truth ought not to be fettered, no matter what orthodoxies he may challenge. Felix Frankfurter

Since people, in a competitive or any other society, are by no means always just to each other, some regulation by the state in its capacity of umpire is unavoidable, What must be kept in mind is that the greatest injustice of all is done when the umpire forgets that he too is bound by the rules, and begins to make them as between contestants in behalf of his own prejudices. Felix Morley

Liberty cannot be caged into a charter or handed on ready-made to the next generation. Each generation must recreate liberty for its own times. Whether or not we establish freedom rests with ourselves. Florence Ellinwood Allen

Freedom is like taking a bath --- you have to keep doing it every day! Florynce KennedyAmerican lawyer, activist, civil rights advocate, feminist

... \[F\]or that nothing doth more hurt in a state, than that cunning men pass for wise. Francis Bacon

If the author of the Declaration of Independence were to utter such a sentiment today, the Post Office Department could exclude him from the mail, grand juries could indict him for sedition and criminal syndicalism, legislative committees could seize his private papers ... and United States Senators would be clamoring for his deportation that he ... should be sent back to live with the rest of the terrorists. Frank I. Cobb

A sure sign of a genius is that all of the dunces are in a confederacy against him. Frank Lloyd Wright

Are we going to take the hands of the federal government completely off any effort to adjust the growing of national crops, and go right straight back to the old principle that every farmer is a lord of his own farm and can do anything he wants, raise anything, any old time, in any quantity, and sell any time he wants? Franklin D. Roosevelt

The constitutionality and propriety of the Federal Government assuming to enter into a novel and vast field of legislation, namely, that of providing for the care and support of all those ? who by any form of calamity become fit objects of public philanthropy. ... I cannot find any authority in the Constitution for making the Federal Government the great almoner of public charity throughout the United States. To do so would, in my judgment, be contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and subversive of the whole theory upon which the Union of these States is founded. Franklin Pierce

To do so would, in my judgment, be contrary to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and subversive of the whole theory upon which the Union of these States is founded. Franklin Pierce

Sometimes the law defends plunder and participates in it. Sometimes the law places the whole apparatus of judges, police, prisons and gendarmes at the service of the plunderers, and treats the victim --- when he defends himself --- as a criminal. Frederic Bastiat

The war against illegal plunder has been fought since the beginning of the world. But how is ... legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime. Then abolish this law without delay ... If such a law is not abolished immediately it will spread, multiply and develop into a system. Frederic Bastiat



Interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the constitution is a Glorious Liberty Document! Frederick Douglass

The non-producers now receive the larger share of what those who labor produce. The result is natural. Discontent culminates in exactly the same ratio that intelligence sustains aspiration. Frederick Douglass

Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are people who want crops without ploughing the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning; they want the ocean without the roar of its many waters. The struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, or it may be both. But it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will. Frederick Douglass



Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one's thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist. Frederick Douglass

To suppress free speech is adouble wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker. Frederick Douglass

A society that does not recognize that each individual has values of his own which he is entitled to follow can have no respect for the dignity of the individual and cannot really know freedom. Fredrich August von Hayek

From the saintly and single-minded idealist to the fanatic is often but a step. Fredrich August von Hayek

Justice, like liberty and coercion, is a concept which, for the sake of clarity, ought to be confined to the deliberate treatment of men by other men. Fredrich August von Hayek

To be controlled in our economic pursuits means to be controlled in everything. Fredrich August von Hayek

To combat depression by a forced credit expansion is to attempt to cure the evil by the very means which brought it about; because we are suffering from a misdirection of production, we want to create further misdirection --- a procedure which can only lead to a much more severe crisis as soon as the credit expansion comes to an end. Fredrich August von Hayek

I am certain that nothing has done so much to destroy the juridical safeguards of individual freedom as the striving after this mirage of social justice. Friedrich August von Hayek

Many of the greatest things man has achieved are not the result of consciously directed thought, and still less the product of a deliberately coordinated effort of many individuals, but of a process in which the individual plays a part which he can never fully understand. Friedrich August von Hayek

The history of government management of money has, except for a few short happy periods, been one of incessant fraud and deception. Friedrich August von Hayek

A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies, becomes unable to recognize truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others. When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love, and in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest form of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal in satisfying his vices. And it all comes from lying to others and to yourself. Fyodor Dostoyevsky

By the time the (16th) Amendment had been approved by the states, the Rockefeller Foundation was in full operation ... about the same time that Judge Kenesaw Landis was ordering the breakup of the Standard Oil monopoly ... John D. ... not only avoided taxes by creating four great tax-exempt foundations; he used them as repositories for his "divested" interests ... made his assets non-taxable so that they might be passed down through generations without ... estate and gift taxes ... Each year the Rockefellers can dump up to half their incomes into their pet foundations and deduct the "donations" from their income tax. Gary Allen

I believe that if we had and would keep our dirty, bloody, dollar-soaked fingers out of the business of these nations so full of depressed, exploited people, they will arrive at a solution of their own --- and if unfortunately their revolution must be of the violent type because the "haves" refuse to share with the "have-nots" by any peaceful method, at least what they get will be their own, and not the American style, which they don't want and above all don't want crammed down their throats by Americans. David M. Shoup

The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel

Liberty means responsibility. That is why most men dread it. George Bernard Shaw

One sword keeps another in the sheath. George Herbert

When the same man, or set of men, holds the sword and the purse, there is an end of liberty. George Mason

Considering the natural lust for power so inherent in man, I fear the thirst of power will prevail to oppress the people. George Mason

All animals are created equal but some animals are more equal than others. George Orwell

Men sleep peacefully in their beds at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf. George Orwell

To see what is in front of one's nose requires a constant struggle. George Orwell

It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather we should thank God that such men lived. George S. Patton Jr.

Fanaticism consists in redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim. George Santayana

Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. George Santayana

Do the people of this land ... desire to preserve those \[liberties\] protected by the First Amendment? If so, let them withstand all beginnings of encroachment. For the saddest epitaph which can be carved in memory of a vanquished liberty is that it was lost because its possessors failed to stretch for a saving hand while yet there was time. George Sutherland

And our security will require all Americans to be forward-looking and resolute, to be ready for pre-emptive action. George W. Bush

We have every reason to assume the worst. George W. Bush

If government could create jobs and raise children, socialism would have worked. Gerald Gilder

If our social conditions curtail manhood and womanhood, we must alter the social conditions. We must not go on quietly in a corner making men unmanly and women unwomanly, that they may fit into their filthy and slavish civilization. Gilbert Keith Chesterton

Tolerance is the virtue of a man without convictions. Gilbert Keith Chesterton

It is proof of a base and low mind for one to wish to think with the masses or majority, merely because the majority is the majority. Truth does not change because it is, or is not, believed by a majority of the people. Giordano Bruno

[T]he people as ultimate sovereigns, retain the ultimate power --- and even the duty --- to overthrow any government that fails to respect their authority. Glenn Harlan Reynolds

The antipode of individualism is collectivism, which subordinates the individual to the group --- be it the "community," the tribe, the race, the proletariat, etc. A person's moral worth is judged by how much he sacrifices himself to the group. \[Under collectivism\] the more emergencies (and victims) the better, because they provide more opportunity for "virtue." Glenn Woiceshyn

A heretic is a man who sees with his own eyes. Gotthold Ephraim Lessing

The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you've got it made. Groucho Marx

I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution, and I do not believe that the power and duty of the General Government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering which is in no manner properly related to the public service or benefit. Grover Cleveland

Under the surface, the Rothschilds long had a powerful influence in dictating American financial laws. The law records show that they were powers in the old Bank of the United States \[abolished by Andrew Jackson\]. Gustav Myers

When a legislature decides to steal some of our rights and plans to use police force to accomplish it, what's the real difference between them and the thief? Darn little! They hide behind the excuse that they're legislating democratically. The fact they do it by a majority vote has no moral significance whatsoever. Numerical might does not constitute right, no more than a lynch mob can justify its act because a majority participated. H. L. Richardson

The banks do create money. They have been doing it for a long time, but they didn't realise it, and they did not admit it. Very few did. You will find it in all sorts of documents, financial textbooks, etc. But in the intervening years, and we must be perfectly frank about these things, there has been a development of thought, until today I doubt very much whether you would get many prominent bankers to attempt to deny that banks create it. H. W. White

The law itself is on trial quite as much as the cause which is to be decided. Harlan F. Stone

Every State is known by the rights it maintains. Harold J. Laski

The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience. Harper Lee

The problem is, of course, that not only is economics bankrupt but it has always been nothing more than politics in disguise ... economics is a form of brain damage. Hazel Henderson

Absolute liberty is absence of restraint; responsibility is restraint; therefore, the ideally free individual is responsible to himself. Henry Brooks Adams

Politics, as a practise, whatever its professions, has always been the systematic organization of hatreds. Henry Brooks Adams

Any fool can make a rule, and any fool will mind it. Henry David Thoreau

Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new. Henry David Thoreau

If the machine of government is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law. Henry David Thoreau

The law will never make men free; it is men who have got to make the law free. Henry David Thoreau

There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly. Henry David Thoreau

It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning. Henry Ford

It is not the business of government to make men virtuous or religious, or to preserve the fool from the consequences of his own folly. Government should be repressive no further than is necessary to secure liberty by protecting the equal rights of each from aggression on the part of others, and the moment governmental prohibitions extend beyond this line they are in danger of defeating the very ends they are intended to serve. Henry George


No man is great enough or wise enough for any of us to surrender our destiny to. The only way in which anyone can lead us is to restore our belief in our own guidance. Henry Miller

Liberty is to the collective body what health is to every individual body. Without health no pleasure can be tasted by man; without liberty, no happiness can be enjoyed by society. --- Henry St. John

Without health no pleasure can be tasted by man; without liberty, no happiness can be enjoyed by society. Henry St. John

Every effort to confine Americanism to a single pattern, to constrain it to a single formula, is disloyalty to everything that is valid in Americanism. Henry Steele Commager

Men in authority will always think that criticism of their policies is dangerous. They will always equate their policies with patriotism, and find criticism subversive. Henry Steele Commager

The truth that makes men free is for the most part the truth which men prefer not to hear. Herbert Sebastien Agar

Feudalism, serfdom, slavery, all tyrannical institutions, are merely the most vigorous kind to rule, springing out of, and necessarily to, a bad state of man. The progress from these is the same in all cases --- less government. Herbert Spencer

Liberty is not the right of one, but of all. Herbert Spencer

The greatest of all infidelities is the fear that the truth will be bad. Herbert Spencer

The liberty the citizen enjoys is to be measured not by governmental machinery he lives under, whether representative or other, but by the paucity of restraints it imposes upon him. Herbert Spencer

The Republican form of government is the highest form of government; but because of this it requires the highest type of human nature --- a type nowhere at present existing. Herbert Spencer

Wisdom is not communicable. The wisdom which a wise man tries to communicate always sounds foolish. Herman Hesse

The censor believes that he can hold back the mighty traffic of life with a tin whistle and a raised right hand. For after all, it is life with which he quarrels. Heywood Broun

Appeasers believe that if you keep on throwing steaks to a tiger, the tiger will turn vegetarian. Heywood Hale Broun

Suffering is but another name for the teaching of experience, which is the parent of instruction and the schoolmaster of life. Horace

Who then is free? The wise man who can command himself. Horace

We have stricken the shackles from 4,000,000 human beings and brought all labourers to a common level, but not so much by the elevation of former slaves as by reducing the whole working population, white and black, to a condition of serfdom. While boasting of our noble deeds, we are careful to conceal the ugly fact that by our iniquitous money system we have manipulated a system of oppression which, though more refined, is no less cruel than the old system of chattel slavery. Horace Greeley

The oppression of any people for opinion's sake has rarely had any other effect than to fix those opinions deeper, and render them more important. Hosea Ballou

The Press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of the government and inform the people. Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people. Hugo L. Black

Ever since Croesus, the first millionaire, invented gold coins, money has depreciated. And the face of the coin has been debased as fast as its value. First the faces of gods were on the coins. Then the faces of kings. Then of presidents. Now there's no face at all. Today it's only paper, with a picture of a public building and the signature of a cashier. Muck! The miracle is that you can still buy things with it. Ian Fleming

Liberty is the possibility of doubting, the possibility of making a mistake, the possibility of searching and experimenting, the possibility of saying "No" to any authority --- literary, artistic, philosophic, religious, social and even political. Ignazio Silone

The work of the individual still remains the spark that moves mankind forward. Igor Sikorsky

The bad thing of war is, that it makes more evil people than it can take away. Immanuel Kant

The enjoyment of power inevitably corrupts the judgment of reason, and perverts its liberty. Immanuel Kant

But to manipulate men, to propel them toward goals which you --- the social reformers --- see, but they may not, is to deny their human essence, to treat them as objects without wills of their own, and therefore to degrade them. Isaiah Berlin

Most new insights come only after a superabundant accumulation of facts have removed the blindness which prevented us from seeing what later comes to be regarded as obvious. Isidor Issac Rabi

We must now face the harsh truth that the objectives of communism are being steadily advanced because many of us do not recognize the means used to advance them ... The individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a Conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists. The American mind simply has not come to a realization of the evil which has been introduced into our midst. J. Edgar Hoover

Fraud may consist as well in the suppression of what is true as in the representation of what is false. If a man professing to answer a question, select those facts only which are likely to give a credit to the person of whom he speaks, and keep back the rest, he is a more artful knave than he who tells a direct falsehood. J. Heath

As long as men are free to ask what they must, free to say what they think, free to think what they will, freedom can never be lost and science can never regress. J. Robert Oppenheimer

The consolidation of power at the federal level in the guise of public safety is a national trend and should be guarded against at all costs. This erosion of rights, however incremental, is the slow death of freedom. We have reached a point where the power of the federal government is such that they can essentially target anyone of their choosing. Recent allegations that government agencies may have targeted political opponents should alarm all Americans, regardless of party affiliation. Revisionist views of the Constitution by opportunistic politicians and unelected judges with agendas that reinterpret the Bill of Rights to take power away from the people and consolidate it at the federal level threaten the core principles of the Republic. As a free people, keeping federal power in check is something that should be of concern to us all. The fundamental value of freedom is what sets us apart from the rest of the world. We are citizens, not subjects, and we must stay ever vigilant that we remain so. Jack Carr

[D]ecade after decade, through taxes and regulations, governments at all levels took ever-increasing control over people?s lives, wealth, and property. The control grew exponentially, decade after decade. The rationale was that the control was necessary --- for society, for the poor, for the nation, even for freedom itself. Americans continued living their life of the lie: they continued believing that the more control government exercised over their lives and property, the freer they became. Jacob G. Hornberger

Communism and fascism or nazism, although poles apart in their intellectual content, are similar in this, that both have emotional appeal to the type of personality that takes pleasure in being submerged in a mass movement and submitting to superior authority. James A. C. Brown

The chief duty of the National Government in connection with the currency of the country is to coin money and declare its value. Grave doubts have been entertained whether Congress is authorized by the Constitution to make any form of paper money legal tender. The present issue of United States notes has been sustained by the necessities of war; but such paper should depend for its value and currency upon its convenience in use and its prompt redemption in coin at the will of the holder, and not upon its compulsory circulation. These notes are not money, but promises to pay money. If the holders demand it, the promise should be kept. James A. Garfield

America is in trouble ... not from without, but from within! The Central Government has become too powerful. Citizens fear the Government. This is wrong. This is dangerous! I know the Government covered-up and promulgated LIES about Waco, Ruby Ridge, Pan Am Flight 103, Hoffa, and J.F.K. The Government knew I was right when I called Janet Reno a traitor. Janet Reno sold us out when she refused to investigate a $10-million payoff to the Democratic Party from a general in the Red Chinese Army (no less!). Think about it! And the Government knew that I had known why Reno was forced to betray America! I'm proud that I tried to do something about it! Someday the truth will come out. (I hope China never attacks us!) James A. Traficant Jr.

Assault weapons laws resemble hate speech laws. Hate speech laws usually begin by targeting a few words that almost no one approves. Once the system for controlling and punishing "hate speech" is put into place, there is little or nothing to stop it from expanding to punish more and more types of everyday speech. Similarly, once an assault weapons law is on the books, there is little to prevent politicians from vastly increasing the number of weapons banned under the law. The main effect of banning assault weapons is to give government an excuse to arrest and imprison millions of Americans while doing little or nothing to reduce crime. America has a limited number of police, and politicians must decide who the real public enemies are. If Mr. Clinton signs an assault weapons ban, it could signal the start of an attack on gun owners' constitutional rights that could far surpass all previous gun bans. James Bovard

Individualism, the love of enterprise, and the pride in personal freedom, have been deemed by Americans not only as their choicest, but their peculiar and exclusive possessions. James Bryce

The politicians don't just want your money. They want your soul. They want you to be worn down by taxes until you are dependent and helpless. James Dale Davidson

Individuality is the aim of political liberty. By leaving to the citizen as much freedom of action and of being as comports with order and the rights of others, the institutions render him truly a free man. He is left to pursue his means of happiness in his own manner. James Fenimore Cooper

Liberty is not a matter of words, but a positive and important condition of society. Its greatest safeguard after placing its foundations in a popular base, is in the checks and balances imposed on the public servants. James Fenimore Cooper

It is not because we have been free, but because we have a right to be free, that we ought to demand freedom. Justice and liberty have neither birth nor race, youth nor age. James MacKintosh

Rules are written for those who lack the ability to truly reason. But for those who can, rules become nothing more than guidelines, and live their lives governed not by rules but by reason. James McGuigan

Let us by wise and constitutional measures promote intelligence among the people as the best means of preserving our liberties. James Monroe

There can be no prescription old enough to supersede the Law of Nature and the grant of God Almighty, who has given to all men a natural right to be free, and they have it ordinarily in their power to make themselves so, if they please. James Otis

... \[I\]n all countries where personal freedom is valued, however much each individual may rely on legal redress, the right of each to carry arms --- and these the best and the sharpest --- for his own protection in case of extremity, is a right of nature indelible and irrepressible, and the more it is sought to be repressed the more it will recur. James Paterson

Toward no crimes have men shown themselves so cold-bloodedly cruel as in punishing differences of opinion. James Russell Lowell

Please explain to us why "Pride Month" is cause for celebration? Are we celebrating individuals who are "brave" enough to act in a manner contrary to God's law? Are we celebrating that God gave them up to dishonorable passions, to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done? So are we suppose to lend our approval to those who have the "guts" to not only live in a way contrary to what God has intended, to break the laws of nature, to mutilate the body of a confused child dragged along by a parent starved for social media attention and more? Ask yourself, does our Creator celebrate "Pride Month?" Is this of God? No it is not. Now, I'm going to be kind, fair and respectful to all who deserve to be treated as such, but I refuse to join in a month of people celebrating that which is contrary to our absolute moral law to which we all are bound, and will all one day give an account of our lives to the Law Giver Himself. Now, that is a very sobering realization to those who have been saved, but to unbelievers, all that matters is themselves; and because they live in the flesh, they CAN'T submit to God's law. To my fellow Christian brothers and sisters, let us hold fast to our faith, so that we are not misled and we finish our race strong when God calls us home. James S. Robinson

It is a general maxim that all governments find a use for as much money as they can raise. Indeed, they have commonly demands for more ... I take this as a settled truth, that they will all spend as much as their revenue; that is, will live up to their income. James Smith

Before the creation of the welfare state, immigrants who came to this country were for the most part attracted by America's reputation as a land of freedom and opportunity. Laws and customs that then prevailed required immigrants to carve out their individual destinies by their own labor, perseverance, intelligence, and determination. James Thornton

Every attempt to gag the free expression of thought is an unsocial act against society. That is why judges and juries who try to enforce such laws make themselves ridiculous. Jay Fox

A wise man neither suffers himself to be governed, nor attempts to govern others. Jean de la Bruyere

I prefer liberty with danger to peace with slavery. Jean-Jacques Rousseau

Man is condemned to be free. Jean-Jacques Rousseau

The problem is to find a form of association which will defend and protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still obey himself alone, and remain as free as before. Jean-Jacques Rousseau

There is no subjugation so perfect as that which keeps the appearance of freedom for in that way one captures volition itself. Jean-Jacques Rousseau

The First Amendment says nothing about a right not to be offended. The risk of finding someone else's speech offensive is the price each of us pays for our own free speech. Free people don't run to court --- or to the principal --- when they encounter a message they don't like. They answer it with one of their own. Jeff Jacoby

Southerners did not stop with an open defense of slavery. They went on to attack northern society for its 'wage slavery' and 'exploitation of workers,' using arguments repeated by socialist critics of capitalism. The southern writer who developed these arguments most extensively was George Fitzhugh, a Virginia planter and lawyer. His two books were provocatively entitled Sociology for the South: Or the Failure of the Free Society and Cannibals All! Or Slaves Without Masters. In them, Fitzhugh defended slavery as a practical form of socialism that provided contented slaves with paternalistic masters, thereby eliminating harsh conflicts between employers and allegedly free workers. 'A Southern farm is the beau ideal of Communism; it is a joint concern, in which the slave ... is far happier, because ... he is always sure of support.' ... 'The best governed countries, and which have prospered the most, have always been distinguished for the number and stringency of their laws,' he wrote; 'liberty is an evil which government is intended to correct.' Jeffrey Rogers Hummel

Among the several cloudy appellatives which have been commonly employed as cloaks for misgovernment, there is none more conspicuous in this atmosphere of illusion than the word 'Order'. Jeremy Bentham

The banks --- commercial banks and the Federal Reserve --- create all the money of this nation and its people pay interest on every dollar of that newly created money. Which means that private banks exercise unconstitutionally, immorally, and ridiculously the power to tax the people. For every newly created dollar dilutes to some extent the value of every other dollar already in circulation. Jerry Voorhis

And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. Jesus of Nazareth

The law is not the private property of lawyers, nor is justice the exclusive province of judges and juries. In the final analysis, true justice is not a matter of courts and law books, but of a commitment in each of us to liberty and mutual respect. Jimmy Carter

Why doesn't everybody leave everybody else the hell alone? Jimmy Durante

We used to be a free people. Now we are hedged in by millions of laws. Harassed by a plague of opportunistic lawyers. Harmed by regulations meant for our protection. Unnecessarily taxed to pay for a suffocating bureaucracy. Drowning in petty paperwork. Stifled by "rights" that rarely benefit anyone. Joan Beck

None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

The essence of war is violence. Moderation in war is imbecility. John A. Fisher

The tendency of all strong governments has always been to suppress liberty, partly in order to ease the processes of rule, partly from sheer disbelief in innovation. John A. Hobson

[D]emocracy will soon degenerate into an anarchy, such an anarchy that every man will do what is right in his own eyes and no man's life or property or reputation or liberty will be secure, and every one of these will soon mould itself into a system of subordination of all the moral virtues and intellectual abilities, all the powers of wealth, beauty, wit and science, to the wanton pleasures, the capricious will, and the execrable cruelty of one or a very few. John Adams

Arms in the hands of individual citizens may be used at individual discretion for the defence of the country, the over-throw of tyranny, or in private self-defense. John Adams

Fear is the foundation of most governments; but it is so sordid and brutal a passion, and renders men in whose breasts it predominates so stupid and miserable, that Americans will not be likely to approve of any political institution which is founded on it. John Adams

Laws for the liberal education of the youth, especially of the lower class of the people, are so extremely wise and useful, that, to a humane and generous mind, no expense for this purpose would be thought extravagant. John Adams

Let justice be done though the heavens should fall. John Adams

Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people, who have ... a right, an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean the characters and conduct of their rulers. John Adams

Nip the shoots of arbitrary power in the bud, is the only maxim which can ever preserve the liberties of any people. John Adams

Resistance to sudden violence, for the preservation not only of my person, my limbs and life, but of my property, is an indisputable right of nature which I have never surrendered to the public by the compact of society, and which perhaps, I could not surrender if I would. Nor is there anything in the common law of England ... inconsistent with that right. John Adams

Nor is there anything in the common law of England inconsistent with that right. John Adams

Statesmen, my dear Sir, may plan and speculate for liberty, but it is religion and morality alone, which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand. The only foundation of a free Constitution is pure virtue, and if this cannot be inspired into our People in a greater Measure than they have it now, they may change their rulers and the forms of government, but they will not obtain a lasting liberty. John Adams

The Revolution was effected before the War commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people; a change in their religious sentiments of their duties and obligations ... This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people, was the real American Revolution. John Adams

There is danger from all men. The only maxim of a free government ought to be to trust no man living with power to endanger the public liberty. John Adams

Let us revise our views and work from the premise that all laws should be for the welfare of society as a whole and not directed at the punishment of sins. John Biggs Jr.

Stripped of all its covering, the naked question is, whether ours is a federal or consolidated government; a constitutional or absolute one; a government resting solidly on the basis of the sovereignty of the States, or on the unrestrained will of a majority; a form of government, as in all other unlimited ones, in which injustice, violence, and force must ultimately prevail. John C. Calhoun

I have never seen more senators express discontent with their jobs. ... I think the major cause is that, deep down in our hearts, we have been accomplices to doing something terrible and unforgivable to this wonderful country. Deep down in our hearts, we know that we have bankrupted America and that we have given our children a legacy of bankruptcy. ... We have defrauded our country to get ourselves elected. John C. Danforth

Now the 21st century approaches and with it the inevitability of change. We must wonder if the American people will find renewal and rejuvenation within themselves, will discover again their capacity for innovation and adaptation. If not, alas, the nation's future will be shaped by sightless forces of history over which Americans will have no control. John Chancellor

Democracy is essentially coercive. The winner gets to use public authority to impose their policies on the losers. John Chubb

Indeed nations, in general, are not apt to think until they feel; and therefore nations in general have lost their liberty: For as violations of the rights of the governed, are commonly not only specious, but small at the beginning, they spread over the multitude in such a manner, as to touch individuals but slightly. Thus they are disregarded. The power or profit that arises from these violations centering in few persons, is to them considerable. For this reason the governors having in view their particular purposes, successively preserve an uniformity of conduct for attaining them. They regularly increase the first injuries, till at length the inattentive people are compelled to perceive the heaviness of their burthens ? They begin to complain and inquire ? but too late. They find their oppressors so strengthened by success, and themselves so entangled in examples of express authority on the part of their rulers, and of tacit recognition on their own part, that they are quite confounded: for millions entertain no other idea of the legality of power, than it is founded on the exercise of power. John Dickenson

I am as free as nature first made man, Ere the base laws of servitude began, When wild in woods the noble savage ran. John Dryden

War is the trade of Kings. John Dryden

Left has come to represent increasing government control. The extreme leftist typically seeks total government. Working their way toward total government power are the Communists, socialists, fascists, and modern liberals who advocate government solutions for every real or imagined problem. John F. McManus

Search the Constitution and you will find no power granted to the legislative branch to make laws governing agriculture, housing, medicine, energy, private ownership or weapons, and a great deal more. John F. McManus

Of all the tasks of government, the most basic is to protect its citizens from violence. John Foster Dulles

I am a Canadian, free to speak without fear, free to worship in my own way, free to stand for what I think right, free to oppose what I believe wrong, or free to choose those who shall govern my country. This heritage of freedom I pledge to uphold for myself and all mankind. John G. Diefenbaker

Truth: the most deadly weapon ever discovered by humanity. Capable of destroying entire perceptual sets, cultures, and realities. Outlawed by all governments everywhere. Possession is normally punishable by death. John Gilmore

It is the duty of a citizen in a free country not to fit into society, but to make society. John Holt

Education ... now seems to me perhaps the most authoritarian and dangerous of all the social inventions of mankind. It is the deepest foundation of the modern slave state, in which most people feel themselves to be nothing but producers, consumers, spectators, and "fans," driven more and more, in all parts of their lives, by greed, envy, and fear. My concern is not to improve "education" but to do away with it, to end the ugly and antihuman business of people-shaping and to allow and help people to shape themselves. John Holt

People who make careers out of helping others --- sometimes at great sacrifice, often not --- usually don't like to hear that those others might get along fine, might even get along better, without their help. John Holt

The Jury has a right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy. John Jay

Attack another's rights and you destroy your own. John Jay Chapman

We simply do not catch a high enough percentage of users to make the law a real threat, although we do catch enough to seriously overburden our legal system. John Kaplan

[E]very Man has a Property in his own Person. This no Body has any Right to but himself. The Labour of his Body, and the Work of his Hands, we may say, are properly his. The great and chief end therefore, of Mens uniting into Commonwealths, and putting themselves under Government, is the Preservation of their Property. John Locke


Individuals have a right to defend themselves and recover by force what by unlawful force is taken from them. John Locke

All men by nature are equal in that equal right that every man hath to his natural freedom, without being subjected to the will or authority of any other man; being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions. John Locke

Freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by, common to every one of that society and made by the legislative power vested in it and not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, arbitrary will of another man. John Locke

I have no reason to suppose that he, who would take away my Liberty, would not when he had me in his Power, take away everything else. John Locke

The right to privacy is one of the most cherished rights an American citizen has; the right to privacy sets America apart from totalitarian states in which the interests of the state prevail over individual rights. A fundamental part of our concept of ordered liberty is the right to protect one?s home and family against dangerous intrusions subject to the criminal law. John Louis Coffey

An unlimited power to tax involves, necessarily, a power to destroy; because there is a limit beyond which no institution and no property can bear taxation. John Marshall

By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose. John Maynard Keynes

The whole freedom of man consists either in spiritual or civil liberty. John Milton

Here the great art lies, to discern in what the law is to be to restraint and punishment, and in what things persuasion only is to work. John Milton

Here the great art lies, to discern in what the law is to be to restraint and punishment, and in what things persuasion only is to work. John Milton

[L]iberty, or the absence of coercion, or the leaving people to think, speak, and act as they please, is in itself a good thing. It is the object of a favourable presumption. The burden of proving it inexpedient always lies, and wholly lies, on those who wish to abridge it by coercion, whether direct or indirect. John Morley

A general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another; and as the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the dominant power in the government, whether this be a monarch, an aristocracy, or a majority of the existing generation; in proportion as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading by a natural tendency to one over the body. John Stuart Mill

In its narrowest acceptation, order means obedience. A government is said to preserve order if it succeeds in getting itself obeyed. John Stuart Mill

Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough; there needs protection against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling, against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them. John Stuart Mill

The only freedom deserving the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest. John Stuart Mill

The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant. John Stuart Mill

The worth of a state, in the long run, is the worth of the individuals composing it. John Stuart Mill

Those who suppress freedom always do so in the name of law and order. John V. Lindsay

We have plenty of freedom in this country but not a great deal of independence. John W. Raper

In recent years we have witnessed numerous marches on Washington in which one group or another has demanded new "rights." Frequently, such rights have not meant freedom from state control, but rather entitlement to state action, protection, or subsidy. In the process of yielding to the "will of the people" and creating new rights, the state invariably enlarges itself and its bureaucracy. Each new right seems to demand a new agency to guarantee it, administer it, or deliver it. John W. Whitehead

The True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe. John Walter Wayland

Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can. John Wesley

To say that subjects in general are not proper judges (of the law) when their governors oppress them and play the tyrant, and when they defend their rights ... is as great a treason as ever a man uttered. Tis treason not against one single man, but against the state --- against the whole body politic; tis treason against mankind; tis treason against Common sense; tis treason against God; And this impious principle lays the foundation for justifying all the tyranny and oppression that ever any prince was guilty of. The people know for what end they set up and maintain their governors, and they are the proper judges when governors execute their trust as they ought to do it. Jonathan Mayhew

It is a maxim among lawyers that whatever hath been done before may be done again, and therefore they take special care to record all the decisions formerly made against common justice and the general reason of mankind. These, under the name of precedents, they produce as authorities to justify the most iniquitous opinions, and the judges never fail of directing them accordingly. Jonathan Swift

You can't reason a man out of a position he was never reasoned into. Jonathan Swift

The press must grow day in and day out --- it is our Party's sharpest and most powerful weapon. Josef Stalin

The Internal Revenue Service is everything the so-called tax protesters said it was; nonresponsive, unable to withstand scrutiny, tyrannical, and oblivious to the rule of law and the U.S. Constitution. Joseph Banister

Did you ever hear anyone say, 'That work had better be banned because I might read it and it might be very damaging to me.'? Joseph Henry Jackson

Our republic and its press will rise and fall together. Joseph Pulitzer

The truth is, that, even with the most secure tenure of office, during good behavior, the danger is not, that the judges will be too firm in resisting public opinion, and in defence of private rights or public liberties; but, that they will be ready to yield themselves to the passions, and politics, and prejudices of the day. Joseph Story

This provision (the 4th Amendment) speaks for itself. Its plain object is to secure the perfect enjoyment of that great right of the common law, that a man's house shall be his own castle, privileged against all civil and military intrusion. Joseph Story

Honesty is the rarest wealth anyone can possess, and yet all the honesty in the world ain't lawful tender for a loaf of bread. Josh Billings

The cry of the soul is for freedom. It longs for liberty, from the date of its first conscious moments. Josiah Gilbert Holland

The right of ordinary citizens to possess weapons is the most extraordinary, most controversial, and least understood of those liberties secured by Englishmen and bequeathed to their American colonists. It lies at the very heart of the relationship between the individual and his fellows, and between the individual and his government. Joyce Lee Malcolm

It's kind of hard to beat gasoline. A lot of the technologies that we think of as being clean ... are not better than gasoline. --- Julian Marshall

In a small Swiss city sits an international organization so obscure and secretive ... Control of the institution, the Bank for International Settlements, lies with some of the world's most powerful and least visible men: the heads of 32 central banks, officials able to shift billions of dollars and alter the course of economies at the stroke of a pen. Keith Bradsher

This manual of the Communist Party should be in the hands of every loyal American, that they may be alerted to the fact that it is not always by armies and guns that a nation is conquered. Kenneth Goff

Liberty is not a cruise ship full of pampered passengers. Liberty is a man-of-war, and we are all crew. Kenneth W. Royce

Absolute, arbitrary power over the lives, liberty and property of freemen exists nowhere in a republic, not even in the largest majority. Kentucky Declaration of Rights

Do not be merciful, but be just, for mercy is bestowed upon the guilty criminal, while justice is all that the innocent man requires. Khalil Gibran

The purpose of the Bill of Rights was to limit what the federal government could do. Any interpretation of a provision of the Bill of Rights as a grant of federal power is ipso facto wrong. L. A. Powe Jr.

Politicians need human misery. ... Government's a disease masquerading as its own cure. L. Neil Smith

Each day, it seemed, another law was passed to impoverish and diminish them, punishing them for whatever success they achieved and rewarding their less competent and industrious neighbors. L. Neil Smith

To pretend to know when you do not know is a disease. Lao-Tzu

... \[W\]e insist on the principle that no danger or crisis, foreign or domestic, will be solved by Americans surrendering more of their constitutional liberties, in the foolish hope that a bigger government will provide greater security. Larry P. Arnn

The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining supercapitalism and communism under the same tent, all under their control ... Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent. Larry P. McDonald

The Declaration of Independence ... is not a legal prescription conferring powers upon the courts; and the Constitution's refusal to "deny or disparage" other rights is far removed from affirming any one of them, and even farther removed from authorizing judges to identify what they might be, and to enforce the judges' list against laws duly enacted by the people. Laura Schlessinger

If the Biden Administration's goal was to purposefully destabilize America and destroy our country from within, it would look absolutely identical to the mess we're in right now. Lauren Boebert


Patterning your life around other's opinions is nothing more than slavery. Lawana Blackwell



I believe that the community is already in process of dissolution where each man begins to eye his neighbor as a possible enemy, where non-conformity with the accepted creed, political as well as religious, is a mark of disaffection; where denunciation, without specification or backing, takes the place of evidence, where orthodoxy chokes freedom of dissent; where faith in the eventual supremacy of reason has become so timid that we dare not enter our convictions in the open lists, to win or lose. Learned Hand



Repeal the entire Banking Act of 1933, and Austrian School economists will cheer, especially if the current system were replaced by a 100%-reserve competitive banking with no central bank. That banking reform would give us a sound money system, meaning no more business cycle, bailouts, or inflation. Lew Rockwell

Even though they are a relatively recent policy development, civil rights laws are considered necessary to insure rights for blacks. But they are, in fact, among the most draconian forms of intervention into the free market. They attack the essence of private property, the ability to exercise control over it. Such laws have resulted in lessened economic freedom, lowered prosperity, heightened social tension, and more trouble for the groups the laws are supposed to help. ... A Korean grocer may want to employ only Korean clerks, a magazine for black professionals only black editors and writers, and a German restaurant only German cooks and waiters. An employer may think that Iraqi-Americans have been unfairly treated and want to favor them. A women's health club may want only women customer's and a men's bar may want only men. There is nothing wrong with any of these behaviors, although civil rights laws seek to end them. In addition to violating the free labor contract, civil rights laws guarantee everyone the right of "access" to "public accommodations" like restaurants, movie theaters, and shops. In fact, what the civil rights laws call public is really private. These businesses are established by private entrepreneurs with private money. The owners should no more be required to serve everyone who comes into their place than they are required to invite everyone to their home for dinner. A large downtown restaurant is as private as a small house in the country. The real difference between private and public is one of ownership, not function or location. Lew Rockwell

What is needed here is a return to the Constitution of the United States. We need to have a complete divorce of Bank and State. The old struggle that was fought out here in Jackson's day must be fought over again ... The Federal Reserve Act should be repealed and the Federal Reserve Banks, having violated their charters, should be liquidated immediately. Faithless Government officers who have violated their oaths of office should be impeached and brought to trial. Louis McFadden

And remember, where you have a concentration of power in a few hands, all too frequently men with the mentality of gangstersget control. History has proven that. All power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. Lord Acton \[John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton\]

Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Lord Acton \[John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton\]

Liberty is the prevention of control by others. This requires self-control and, therefore, religious and spiritual influences; education, knowledge, well-being. Lord Acton

Know ye not who would be free themselves must strike the blow? by their right arms the conquest must be wrought? Lord Byron

To argue against any breach of liberty from the ill use that may be made of it, is to argue against liberty itself, since all is capable of being abused. Lord George Lyttleton

To argue against any breach of liberty from the ill use that may be made of it, is to argue against liberty itself, since all is capable of being abused. Lord George Lyttleton

Few persons enjoy real liberty; we are all slaves to ideas or habits. Louis Charles Alfred de Musset

At the foundation of our civil liberties lies the principle that denies to government officials an exceptional position before the law and which subjects them to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. Louis D. Brandeis

At the foundation of our civil liberties lies the principle that denies to government officials an exceptional position before the law and which subjects them to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. Louis D. Brandeis

Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding. Louis D. Brandeis

The makers of our constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness ... They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the government, the right to be let alone --- the most comprehensive of the rights and the right most valued by civilized men. Louis D. Brandeis

Ways may someday be developed by which the government, without removing papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home. Louis D. Brandeis

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is eager to enter into close relationship with the Bank for International Settlements ... The conclusion is impossible to escape that the State and Treasury Departments are willing to pool the banking system of Europe and America, setting up a world financial power independent of and above the Government of the United States ... The United States under present conditions will be transformed from the most active of manufacturing nations into a consuming and importing nation with a balance of trade against it. Louis McFadden

What is needed here is a return to the Constitution of the United States. We need to have a complete divorce of Bank and State. The old struggle that was fought out here in Jackson's day must be fought over again ... The Federal Reserve Act should be repealed and the Federal Reserve Banks, having violated their charters, should be liquidated immediately. Faithless Government officers who have violated their oaths of office should be impeached and brought to trial. Unless this is done by us, I predict that the American people, outraged, robbed, pillaged, insulted, and betrayed as they are in their own land, will rise in their wrath and send a President here who will sweep the money changers out of the temple. Louis McFadden

Tis the upright mind that holds true sovereignty. Lucius Annaeus Seneca

Every step which leads from capitalism toward planning is necessarily a step nearer to absolutism and dictatorship. - Ludwig von Mises

Socialism is not in the least what it pretends to be. It is not the pioneer of a better and finer world, but the spoiler of what thousands of years of civilization have created. It does not build, it destroys. For destruction is the essence of it. It produces nothing, it only consumes what the social order based on private ownership in the means of production has created. Ludwig von Mises



Nothing is so difficult as not deceiving oneself. Ludwig Wittgenstein

By the power to lay and collect imposts Congress may impose duties on any or every article of commerce imported into these states to what amount they please. By the power to lay excises, a power very odious in its nature, since it authorizes officers to examine into your private concerns, the Congress may impose duties on every article of use or consumption: On the food that we eat, on the liquors we drink, on the clothes that we wear, the glass which enlighten our houses, or the hearths necessary for our warmth and comfort. By the power to lay and collect taxes, they may proceed to direct taxation on every individual either by a capitation tax on their heads or an assessment on their property. By this part of the section, therefore, the government has a power to tax to what amount they choose and thus to sluice the people at every vein as long as they have a drop of blood left. Luther Martin

When they took the 4th Amendment, I was quiet because I didn't deal drugs. When they took the 6th Amendment, I was quiet because I am innocent. When they took the 2nd Amendment, I was quiet because I don't own a gun. Now they have taken the 1st Amendment, and I can only be quiet. Lyle Myhr




The Rothschilds, and that class of money-lenders of whom they are the representatives and agents --- men who never think of lending a shilling to their next-door neighbors, for purposes of honest industry, unless upon the most ample security, and at the highest rate of interest --- stand ready, at all times, to lend money in unlimited amounts to those robbers and murderers, who call themselves governments, to be expended in shooting down those who do not submit quietly to being robbed and enslaved. Lysander Spooner

Vices are those acts by which a man harms himself or his property. Crimes are those acts by which one man harms the person or property of another. Vices are simply the errors which a man makes in his search after his own happiness. Unlike crimes, they imply no malice toward others, and no interference with their persons or property. In vices, the very essence of crime --- that is, the design to injure the person or property of another --- is wanting. It is a maxim of the law that there can be no crime without criminal intent; that is, without the intent to invade the person or property of another. But no one ever practices a vice with any such criminal intent. He practices his vice for his own happiness solely, and not from any malice toward others. Unless this clear distinction between vices and crimes be made and recognized by the laws, there can be on earth no such thing as individual right, liberty, or property, and the corresponding coequal rights of another man to the control of his own person and property. Lysander Spooner

O liberty! how many crimes are committed in thy name! Madame Jeanne Marie Phlipon de La Platiere Roland

Freedom is not worth living if it does not connote freedom to err. It passes my comprehension how human beings, be they ever so experienced and able, can delight in depriving other human beings of that previous right. Mahatma Mohandas K. Gandhi

In matters of conscience, the law of majority has no place. Mahatma Mohandas K. Gandhi

The human voice can never reach the distance that is covered by the still small voice of conscience. Mahatma Mohandas K. Gandhi

Truth never damages a cause that is just. Mahatma Mohandas K. Gandhi

The modern banking system manufactures 'money' out of nothing; and the process is, perhaps, the most, astounding piece of 'sleight of hand' that was ever invented. In fact, it was not invented. It merely 'grew.' ... Banks in fact are able to create (and cancel) modern 'deposit money,' just as much as they were originally able to create, or call in, their own original forms of private notes. They can, in fact, inflate and deflate, i.e., mint, and un-mint the modern 'ledger-entry' currency. Major L. L. B. Angas

Today government touches everything in America and harms almost everything it touches. Federal, state, and local governments together spend 42 out of every 100 dollars we earn. Those who do the taxing and spending have long since ceased to work for the people as a whole. Rather, they work for themselves and for their clients --- the education industry, the welfare culture, public-employee unions, etc.. Malcolm Wallop

Endless money forms the sinews of war. Marcus Tullius Cicero

Liberty is rendered even more precious by the recollection of servitude. Marcus Tullius Cicero

The budget should be balanced, the Treasury should be refilled, public debt should be reduced, the arrogance of officialdom should be tempered and controlled, and the assistance to foreign lands should be curtailed lest Rome become bankrupt. People must again learn to work, instead of living on public assistance. Marcus Tullius Cicero

The recovery of freedom is so splendid a thing that we must not shun even death when seeking to recover it. Marcus Tullius Cicero

There exists a law, not written down anywhere, but inborn in our hearts, a law which comes to us not by training or custom or reading, a law which has come to us not from theory but from practice, not by instruction but by natural intuition. I refer to the law which lays down that, if our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies, any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. Marcus Tullius Cicero

To freemen, threats are impotent. Marcus Tullius Cicero

We should not expect the state to appear in the guise of an extravagant good fairy at every christening, a loquacious companion at every stage of life's journey, and the unknown mourner at every funeral. Margaret Thatcher

Nothing can so alienate a voter from the political system as backing a winning candidate. Mark B. Cohen

Perhaps Communists had wormed their way so deeply into our government on both the working and planning levels that they were able to exercise an inordinate degree of power in shaping the course of America in the dangerous postwar era. I could not help wondering and worrying whether we were faced with open enemies across the conference table and hidden enemies who sat with us in our most secret councils. General Mark Clark

Collectivist ethical principle: man is not an end to himself, but is only a tool to serve the ends of others. Whether those "others" are a dictator's gang, the nation, society, the race, (the) god(s), the majority, the community, the tribe, etc., is irrelevant --- the point is that man in principle must be sacrificed to others. Mark Da Cunha

Here in America, government began as a tool to assure freedom. It gradually turned into a hideously expensive political toy designed to redistribute your wealth and control most aspects of your business and private life. Mark Skousen

Today's political leaders demonstrate their low opinion of the public with every social law they pass. They believe that, if given the right to chose, the citizenry will probably make the wrong choice. Legislators not think any more in terms of persuading people; they feel the need to force their agenda on the public at the point of a bayonet and the barrel of a gun, in the name of the IRS, the SEC, the FDA, the DEA, the EPA, or a multitude of other ABCs of government authority. Mark Skousen

For in a Republic, who is "the country?" Is it the Government which is for the moment in the saddle? Why, the Government is merely a servant --- merely a temporary servant; it cannot be its prerogative to determine what is right and what is wrong, and decide who is a patriot and who isn't. Its function is to obey orders, not originate them. Mark Twain

How you can win the population for war: At first, the statesman will invent cheap lying, that impute the guilt of the attacked nation, and each person will be happy over this deceit, that calm the conscience. It will study it detailed and refuse to test arguments of the other opinion. So he will convince step for step even therefrom that the war is just and thank God, that he, after this process of grotesque even deceit, can sleep better. Mark Twain

If you don't read the newspaper you are uninformed, if you do read the newspaper you are misinformed. Mark Twain

No man's life, liberty, or property are safe while the congress is in session. Mark Twain

Nothing so needs reforming as other people's habits. Mark Twain

The mania for giving the Government power to meddle with the private affairs of cities or citizens is likely to cause endless trouble, through the rivaly of schools and creeds that are anxious to obtain official recognition, and there is great danger that our people will lose our independence of thought and action which is the cause of much of our greatness, and sink into the helplessness of the Frenchman or German who expects his government to feed him when hungry, clothe him when naked, to prescribe when his child may be born and when he may die, and, in time, to regulate every act of humanity from the cradle to the tomb, including the manner in which he may seek future admission to paradise. Mark Twain

Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines, Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Mark Twain

The public is hedged about by so many goddam bookkeepers that no time is left in which to produce. More time is spent in carrying out garbage than in carrying in food. Martin H. Fischer

It is precisely because education is the road to equality and citizenship, that it has been made more elusive for Negroes than many other rights. The walling off of Negroes from equal education is part of the historical design to submerge him in second class status. Therefore, as Negroes have struggled to be free they have had to fight for the opportunity for a decent education. Martin Luther King Jr.

The group consisting of mother, father and child is the main educational agency of mankind. Martin Luther King Jr.

The Negro has no room to make any substantial compromises because his store of advantages is too small. He must press unrelentingly for quality, integrated education or his whole drive for freedom will be undermined by the absence of a most vital and indispensable element --- learning. Martin Luther King Jr.

Ask the first man you meet what he means by defending freedom, and he'll tell you privately he means defending the standard of living. Martin Niemoeller

[T]he Swiss people are the best practitioners of the ideals of non-aggression. The Swiss national government posts are parttime positions. Most decisions are made at the canton (state) level. Swiss per capita income is the highest in the world, showing that non-aggression pays. How did the Swiss come to adopt a relatively non-aggressive constitution in an aggressive world? In the mid-1800s, they imitated our constitution and stuck with it! Mary J. Ruwart

The people have a right to keep and bear arms for the common defense. And as, in times of peace, armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the Legislature; and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordination to the Civil authority, and be governed by it. Massachusetts Constitution

By the sword we seek peace, but peace only under liberty. Massachusetts State Motto

The state calls its own violence law, but that of the individual crime. Max Stirner

Congress will ever exercise their powers to levy as much money as the people can pay. They will not be restrained from direct taxes by the consideration that necessity does not require them. Melancton Smith

Everything is destroyed by its own particular vice: the destructive power resides within. Rust destroys iron, moths destroy clothes, the worm eats away the wood; but greatest of all evils is envy, impious habitant of corrupt souls, which ever was, is, and shall be a consuming disease. Menander

Let men decide firmly what they will not do, and they will be free to do vigorously what they ought to do. Mencius

It is necessary for every American, with becoming energy to endeavor to stop the dissemination of principles evidently destructive of the cause for which they have bled. It must be the combined virtue of the rulers and of the people to do this, and to rescue and save their civil and religious rights from the outstretched arm of tyranny, which may appear under any mode or form of government. Mercy Warren

Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus. Michael Crichton

If we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth. Michael Flynn

If Big Brother comes to America, he will not be a fearsome, foreboding figure with a heart-chilling, omnipresent glare as in 1984. He will come with a smile on his face, a quip on his lips, a wave to the crowd, and a press that (a) dutifully reports the suppressive measures he is taking to save the nation from internal chaos and foreign threat; and (b) gingerly questions whether he will be able to succeed. Michael Parenti

The worst forms of tyranny, or certainly the most successful ones, are not those we rail against but those that so insinuate themselves into the imagery of our consciousness, and the fabric of our lives, as not to be perceived as tyranny. Michael Parenti

It was the Republican Party that demolished the shining city on the hill my father built. It was the Republican Party that was 100 percent responsible for the end of the Reagan Revolution ... \[T\]he Republican Party abandoned the trail leading to that shining city on the hill to become itself a quasi-Left-wing organization which looks at the Democrats' welfare programs and says "me too." Michael Reagan

Most people prefer to believe that their leaders are just and fair, even in the face of evidence to the contrary, because once a citizen acknowledges that the government under which he lives is lying and corrupt, the citizen has to choose what he or she will do about it. To take action in the face of corrupt government entails risks of harm to life and loved ones. To choose to do nothing is to surrender one's self-image of standing for principles. Most people do not have the courage to face that choice. Hence, most propaganda is not designed to fool the critical thinker but only to give moral cowards an excuse not to think at all. Michael Rivero

The surest way to ruin a promising career in economics, whether professional or academic, is to venture into the "cranks and crackpots" world of suggestions for reform of the financial system. Michael Rowbotham

Ruff's Third Law of Economic Dynamics: 'An economy in motion tends to stay in motion, and an economy at rest tends to stay at rest. A free market is constantly in motion. A centrally planned market slows until it eventually dies completely. Mike Ruff

Anyone who tells you that 'It Can't Happen Here' is whistling past the graveyard of history. There is no 'house rule' that bars tyranny coming to America. History is replete with republics whose people grew complacent and descended into imperial butchery and chaos. Mike Vanderboegh

I'm in favor of legalizing drugs. According to my value system, if people want to kill themselves, they have every right to do so. Most of the harm that comes from drugs is because they are illegal. Milton Friedman


The Fed was largely responsible for converting what might have been a garden-variety recession, although perhaps a fairly severe one, into a major catastrophe. Instead of using its powers to offset the depression, it presided over a decline in the quantity of money by one-third from 1929 to 1933 ... Far from the depression being a failure of the free-enterprise system, it was a tragic failure of government. Milton Friedman

The power to determine the quantity of money ... is too important, too pervasive, to be exercised by a few people, however public-spirited, if there is any feasible alternative. There is no need for such arbitrary power ... Any system which gives so much power and so much discretion to a few men, \[so\] that mistakes --- excusable or not --- can have such far reaching effects, is a bad system. It is a bad system to believers in freedom just because it gives a few men such power without any effective check by the body politic --- this is the key political argument against an independent central bank. Milton Friedman

The strongest argument for free enterprise is that it prevents anybody from having too much power. Whether that person is a government official, a trade union official, or a business executive. If forces them to put up or shut up. They either have to deliver the goods, produce something that people are willing to pay for, are willing to buy, or else they have to go into a different business. Milton Friedman

The unions might be good for the people who are in the unions but it doesn't do a thing for the people who are unemployed. Because the union keeps down the number of jobs, it doesn't do a thing for them. Milton Friedman

With respect to teachers' salaries ... Poor teachers are grossly overpaid and good teachers grossly underpaid. Salary schedules tend to be uniform and determined far more by seniority. Milton Friedman

Hypocrisy is a fashionable vice, and all fashionable vices pass for virtue. Moliere

It is not the business of the law to make anyone good or reverent or moral or clean or upright. Murray N. Rothbard

We must, therefore, emphasize that 'we' are not the government; the government is not 'us.' The government does not in any accurate sense 'represent' the majority of the people. But, even if it did, even if 70 percent of the people decided to murder the remaining 30 percent, this would still be murder and would not be voluntary suicide on the part of the slaughtered minority. No organicist metaphor, no irrelevant bromide that 'we are all part of one another,' must be permitted to obscure this basic fact. Murray N. Rothbard

There are only two forces in the world, the sword and the spirit. In the long run the sword will always be conquered by the spirit. Napoleon Bonaparte

When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes ... Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain. Napoleon Bonaparte

I can't think of anything that would do more toward putting us back on the road to liberty and personal responsibility than for the average American, and for the news media, to come to the understanding that we are not a democracy, nor were we supposed to be. Neal Boortz

Whatever the immediate gains and losses, the dangers to our safety arising from political suppression are always greater than the dangers to the safety resulting from political freedom. Suppression is always foolish. Neil A. McDonald

I have always believed that government had a limited capacity to do good and a virtually infinite capacity to do harm ... Neil Hamilton

The function of socialism is to raise suffering to a higher level. Norman Mailer

If there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought --- not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

One of the eternal conflicts out of which life is made up is that between the effort of every man to get the most he can for his services, and that of society, disguised under the name of capital, to get his services for the least possible return. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

The jury has the power to bring a verdict in the teeth of both law and fact. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.

Liberty is often a heavy burden on a man. It involves the necessity for perpetual choice which is the kind of labor men have always dreaded. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.

Be assured that if this new provision \[the 14th Amendment\] be engrafted in the Constitution, it will, in time, change the entire structure and texture of our government, and sweep away all the guarantees of safety devised and provided by our patriotic Sires of the Revolution. Orville Browning

All authority is quite degrading. Oscar Wilde

A little government and a little luck are necessary in life, but only a fool trusts either of them. P. J. O'Rourke

Feeling good about government is like looking on the bright side of any catastrophe. When you quit looking on the bright side, the catastrophe is still there. P. J. O'Rourke

Nobody should be compelled to respect an ideology that doesn't respect them. Pat Condell

We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth ... For my part, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst; and to provide for it. Patrick Henry

It was self-serving politicians who convinced recent generations of Americans that we could all stand in a circle with our hands in each other's pockets and somehow get rich. Paul Harvey

The study of history is a powerful antidote to contemporary arrogance. Paul Johnson

If you depart from moral absolutes, you go into a bottomless pit. Communism and Naziism were catastrophic evils which both derived from moral relativism. Their differences were minor compared to their similarities. Paul Johnson Historian

Conformity and obedience, Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth, Makes slaves of men and of the human frame, A mechanized automaton. Percy Bysshe Shelley

The Founding Fathers of this great land had no difficulty whatsoever understanding the agenda of bankers, and they frequently referred to them and their kind as, quote, 'friends of paper money.' They hated the Bank of England, in particular, and felt that even were we successful in winning our independence from England and King George, we could never truly be a nation of freemen, unless we had an honest money system. Through ignorance, but moreover, because of apathy, a small, but wealthy, clique of power brokers have robbed us of our Rights and Liberties, and we are being raped of our wealth. We are paying the price for the near-comatose levels of complacency by our parents, and only God knows what might become of our children, should we not work diligently to shake this country from its slumber! Many a nation has lost its freedom at the end of a gun barrel, but here in America, we just decided to hand it over voluntarily. Worse yet, we paid for the tyranny and usurpation out of our own pockets with 'voluntary' tax contributions and the use of a debt-laden fiat currency! Peter Kershaw Author of the 1994 booklet 'Economic Solutions'

Freedom of the press, freedom of association, the inviolability of domicile, and all the rest of the rights of man are respected so long as no one tries to use them against the privileged class. On the day they are launched against the privileged they are overthrown. Peter Kropotkin

The knowledge of the world is only to be acquired in the world, and not in a closet. Philip Dormer Stanhope

Coercion by government, the main fear of our founding fathers, is now its most common attribute. Philip K. Howard

One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors. Plato

Strange times are these in which we live when old and young are taught in falsehood's school. And the one man who dares to tell the truth is called at once a lunatic and fool. Plato

The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness ... This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs, when he first appears he is a protector. Plato

The worst of all deceptions is self-deception. Plato

Your silence gives consent. Plato

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Pledge of Allegiance

[A] function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve it's high purpose when it indices a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with things as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for understanding. Potter Stewart

The 4th Amendment and the personal rights it secures have a long history. At the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion. Potter Stewart

The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going. Proverbs

We are corrupted by prosperity. And when the state is corrupt, then the laws are most multiplied. Publius Cornelius Tacitus

No one is free who is not master of himself. Pythagoras

For the average family, all these taxes now eat 38 percent of gross income, a higher rate of taxation than ever before in the peacetime history of the United States. By comparison, the typical two-income family in the mid-1950s paid 28 percent of their income for taxes. We're now at the absurd point where the typical family works until noon of every working day to satisfy the taxman, paying more in taxes than they spend for food, clothing and housing combined. Ralph Reiland

Liberty is a slow fruit. Ralph Waldo Emerson

The less government we have the better --- the fewer laws and the less confided power. The antidote to this abuse of formal government is the influence of private character, the growth of the individual. Ralph Waldo Emerson

Monetary policy today is guided by little more than government fiat --- by the calculations, often mistaken economic theories, and whims of central bankers or, even worse, politicians. Under such a regime, inflation of three or four percent annually has come to be viewed as a stellar monetary performance. However, under a more sound monetary system --- i.e., a gold standard --- such increases in the general price level would be seen as wildly inflationary. Raymond J. Keating

The central premise of constitutional governance is that 'We the people' have the power and the right to alter or abolish the form of government under which we live. Raymond Ku

I am afraid that the ordinary citizen will not like to be told that the banks can and do create and destroy money. And they who control the credit of a nation direct the policy of governments, and hold in the hollow of their hands the destiny of the people. Reginald McKenna

To the extent that these \[New Deal policies\] developed, they were tortured interpretations of a document \[the Constitution\] intended to prevent them. Rexford Tugwell

The first duty of government is to protect the citizen from assault. Unless it does this, all the civil rights and civil liberties in the world aren't worth a dime. Richard A. Viguerie

Three groups spend other people's money: children, thieves, politicians. All three need supervision. Richard Armey

There are no mistakes. The events we bring upon ourselves, no matter how unpleasant, are necessary in order to learn what we need to learn; whatever steps we take, they're necessary to reach the places we've chosen to go. Richard Bach

In a free society, standards of public morality can be measured only by whether physical coercion --- violence against persons or property --- occurs. There is no right not to be offended by words, actions or symbols. Richard E. Sincere Jr.

I think that every true reformer, every real friend of liberty, will agree with me in saying that if we must erect safeguards, they should be rather for the security of the individual than of the mass, and that our chiefest care must be to train the majority to respect the rights of the minority, to prevent the claims of the few from being trampled under foot by the caprice or passion of the many. Richard John Cartwright

In a free society, standards of public morality can be measured only by whether physical coercion --- violence against persons or property --- occurs. There is no right not to be offended by words, actions or symbols. Richard E. Sincere Jr.

It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.' ― Richard Feynman

Free enterprise capitalism exists only when people in the private sector are free to pursue their own interests without direction from government. When politicians start passing laws to tell them what to do, or bureaucrats start issuing edicts to tell them what to do, it is no longer capitalism; it's fascism. Rick Gaber

The single most frightening thing you encounter is confidence-in-government because it's so common. Rick Gaber

[T]here seems to have been an actual decline in rational thinking. The United States had become a place where entertainers and professional athletes were mistaken for people of importance. They were idolized and treated as leaders; their opinions were sought on everything and they took themselves just as seriously --- after all, if an athlete is paid a million or more a year, he knows he is important ... so his opinions of foreign affairs and domestic policies must be important, too, even though he proves himself to be ignorant and subliterate every time he opens his mouth. Robert A. Heinlein

Political tags --- such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist, fascist, liberal, conservative, and so forth --- are never basic criteria. The human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and those who have no such desire. Robert A. Heinlein

There is no worse tyranny than to force a man to pay for what he does not want merely because you think it would be good for him. Robert A. Heinlein

The fundamental principle is this: No matter how worthwhile an end may be, if there is no constitutional authority to pursue it, then the federal government must step aside and leave the matter to the states or to private parties. The president and Congress can proceed only from constitutional authority, not from good intentions alone. If Congress thinks it necessary to expand its powers, the Framers crafted an amendment process for that purpose. But too often, rather than follow that process, Congress has disregarded the limits set by the Constitution and gutted our frontline defense against overweening federal government. Robert A. Levy

Because this right \[of self-defense\] cannot be effectively exercised with bare hands, the right to keep and bear arms is the only efficient way to secure the fundamental right of self-defense. Robert Dowlut

The problem of power is how to achieve its responsible use rather than its irresponsible and indulgent use --- of how to get men of power to live for the public rather than off the public. Robert F. Kennedy

At the heart of western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man ... is the touchstone of value, and all society, groups, the state, exist for his benefit. Therefore the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal and abiding practice of any western society. Robert F. Kennedy

It is not the function of the government to keep the citizen from falling into error; it is the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling into error. Robert H. Jackson

The very purpose of a Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections. Robert H. Jackson

Very commonly in ages when civil rights of one kind are in evidence --- those pertaining to freedom of speech and thought in, say, theater, press, and forum, with obscenity and libel laws correspondingly loosened --- very real constrictions of individual liberty take place in other, more vital areas: political organization, voluntary association, property, and the right to hold jobs, for example. Robert Nisbet

19 terrorists in 6 weeks have been able to command 300 million North Americans to do away with the entirety of their civil liberties that took 700 years to advance from the Magna Carta onward. The terrorists have already won the political and ideological war with one terrorist act. It is mindboggling that we are that weak as a society. Rocco Galati

Congress is continually appointing fact-finding committees, when what we really need are some fact-facing committees. Roger Allen

There are in fact four very significant stumblingblocks in the way of grasping the truth, which hinder every man however learned, and scarcely allow anyone to win a clear title to wisdom, namely, the example of weak and unworthy authority, longstanding custom, the feeling of the ignorant crowd, and the hiding of our own ignorance while making a display of our apparent knowledge. Roger Bacon

The fault lies not with our technologies but with our systems. Roger Levian

Over the 20th century, the federal government has assumed a vast and unprecedented set of powers. Not only has the exercise of those powers upset the balance between federal and state governments; run roughshod over individuals, families, and firms; and reduced economic opportunity for all; but most of what the federal government does today --- to put the point as plainly and candidly as possible --- is illegitimate because done without explicit constitutional authority. The time has come to start returning power to the states and the people, to relimit federal power in our fundamental law, to restore constitutional government. Roger Pilon

Today, of course, the redistributive powers of Congress are everywhere --- except in the Constitution. The result is the feeding frenzy that is modern Washington, the Hobbesian war of all against all as each tries to get his share and more of the common pot the tax system fills. ... It is unseemly and wrong. More than that, it is unconstitutional, whatever the slim and cowed majority on the New Deal Court may have said. Roger Pilon

It's a mistake to think that poor people get the benefit from the welfare system. It's a total fraud. Most welfare go to the rich of this country: the military-industrial complex, the bankers, the foreign dictators, it's totally out of control. \[...\] This idea that the government has services or goods that they can pass on is a complete farce. Governments have nothing. They can't create anything, they never have. All they can do is steal from one group and give it to another at the destruction of the principles of freedom, and we ought to challenge that concept. Ron Paul

Why is patriotism thought to be blind loyalty to the government and the politicians who run it, rather than loyalty to the principles of liberty and support for the people? Real patriotism is a willingness to challenge the government when it's wrong. Ron Paul

The NRA believes America's laws were made to be obeyed and that our Constitutional liberties are just as important today as 200 years ago. And by the way, the Constitution does not say Government shall decree the right to keep and bear arms. The Constitution says "The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." Ronald Reagan

We don't have inflation because the people are living too well, we have inflation because government is living too well. Ronald Reagan

Keep voting Democrat. One day they will restrict your freedoms, restrict your history and restrict your safety. All in the name of professional victims that don't understand the consequences of their ignorance. Ronald Regan

Freedom for supporters of the government only, for members of one party only --- no matter how big its membership may be --- is no freedom at all. Freedom is always freedom for the man who thinks differently. Rosa Luxemburg

Is it not ironical that in a planned society of controlled workers given compulsory assignments, where religious expression is suppressed, the press controlled, and all media of communication censored, where a puppet government is encouraged but denied any real authority, where great attention is given to efficiency and character reports, and attendance at cultural assemblies is mandatory, where it is avowed that all will be administered to each according to his needs and performance required from each according to his abilities, and where those who flee are tracked down, returned, and punished for trying to escape --- in short in the milieu of the typical large American secondary school --- we attempt to teach 'the democratic system'? Royce Van Norman

Nobody can be trusted with unlimited power. The more power a regime has, the more likely people will be killed. This is a major reason for promoting freedom. Rudolph Rummel

What we don't see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do. Rudolph W. Giuliani

Few men desire liberty; most men wish only for a just master. Sallust

Among the natural rights \[of the people\] are these: first, a right to life; secondly, to liberty; thirdly to property; together with the right to support and defend them in the best manner they can. Samuel Adams

Among the innumerable mortifications which waylay human arrogance on every side may well be reckoned our ignorance of the most common objects and effects, a defect of which we become more sensible by every attempt to supply it. Vulgar and inactive minds confound familiarity with knowledge and conceive themselves informed of the whole nature of things when they are shown their form or told their use; but the speculatist, who is not content with superficial views, harasses himself with fruitless curiosity, and still, as he inquires more, perceives only that he knows less. Samuel Johnson

Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. Samuel Johnson

Do we desire to be cradled, and then carried throughout life to our graves by this partisan propelled bureaucratic monstrosity? ... as individuals of sovereign dignity, are we now so terrified, bewildered, and impotent that our main purpose is to seek asylum from the potential hazards of freedom? Have we no faith in our natural strengths and abilities? Sergei Hoff

A fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity. Sigmund Freud

This is, in theory, still a free country, but our politically correct, censorious times are such that many of us tremble to give vent to perfectly acceptable views for fear of condemnation. Freedom of speech is thereby imperiled, big questions go undebated, and great lies become accepted, unequivocally as great truths. Simon Heffer

A half truth is the worst of all lies, because it can be defended in partiality. Solon

Truth always rests with the minority, and the minority is always stronger than the majority, because the minority is generally formed by those who really have an opinion, while the strength of a majority is illusory, formed by the gangs who have no opinion --- and who, therefore, in the next instant (when it is evident that the minority is the stronger) assume its opinion ... while Truth again reverts to a new minority. Soren Kierkegaard

For those who believe, no proof is necessary. For those who don't believe, no proof is possible. Stuart Chase

Nobody can be so amusingly arrogant as a young man who has just discovered an old idea and thinks it is his own. Sydney J. Harris

I don't like the income tax. Every time we talk about these taxes we get around to the idea of 'from each according to his capacity and to each according to his needs'. That's socialism. It's written into the Communist Manifesto. Maybe we ought to see that every person who gets a tax return receives a copy of the Communist Manifesto with it so he can see what's happening to him. T. Coleman Andrews

Tradition is the means by which the vitality of the past enriches the life of the present. T. S. Eliot

[T]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments, but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people. Tench Coxe

Since the federal constitution has removed all danger of our having a paper tender, our trade is advanced fifty percent. Our monied people can trust their cash abroad, and have brought their coin into circulation. The Pennsylvania Gazette December 16, 1789

If you add to the truth, you subtract from it. The Talmud

The creation of money exclusively as debt is the critical, destabilizing flaw in the American Economy. Theodore R. Thoren

Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day. Theodore Roosevelt

The man who loves other countries as much as his own stands on a level with the man who loves other women as much as he loves his own wife. Theodore Roosevelt

But, sir, the people themselves have it in their power effectually to resist usurpation, without being driven to an appeal of arms. An act of usurpation is not obligatory; it is not law; and any man may be justified in his resistance. Let him be considered as a criminal by the general government, yet only his fellow-citizens can convict him; they are his jury, and if they pronounce him innocent, not all the powers of Congress can hurt him; and innocent they certainly will pronounce him, if the supposed law he resisted was an act of usurpation. Theophilus Parsons

One of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation. Thomas B. Reed

American democracy must be a failure because it places the supreme authority in the hands of the poorest and most ignorant part of the society. Thomas Babington Macaulay

And to say that society ought to be governed by the opinion of the wisest and best, though true, is useless. Whose opinion is to decide who are the wisest and best? Thomas Babington Macaulay

As freedom is the only safeguard of governments, so are order and moderation generally necessary to preserve freedom. Thomas Babington Macaulay

Nothing is so galling to a people not broken in from birth as a paternal, or, in other words, a meddling government, a government which tells them what to read, and say, and eat, and drink and wear. Thomas Babington Macaulay

Persecution produced its natural effect on them. It found them a sect; it made them a faction. Thomas Babington Macaulay

There is surely no contradiction in saying that a certain section of the community may be quite competent to protect the persons and property of the rest, yet quite unfit to direct our opinions, or to superintend our private habits. Thomas Babington Macaulay

To punish a man because we infer from the nature of some doctrine which he holds, or from the conduct of other persons who hold the same doctrines with him, that he will commit a crime, is persecution, and is, in every case, foolish and wicked. Thomas Babington Macaulay

Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses nature leads, or you shall learn nothing. Thomas Henry Huxley

My business is to bring my aspirations to conform to fact, not to try to harmonize fact with my aspirations. Thomas Henry Huxley

Suppression of expression conceals the real problems confronting a society and diverts public attention from the critical issues. It is likely to result in neglect of the grievances which are the actual basis of the unrest, and this prevent their correction. Thomas I. Emerson

Let therefore every man, that, appealing to his own heart, feels the least spark of virtue or freedom there, think that it is an honor which he owes himself, and a duty which he owes his country, to bear arms. Thomas Pownhall

The proverb warns that 'You should not bite the hand that feeds you.' But maybe you should if it prevents you from feeding yourself. Thomas Szasz

Be convinced that to be happy means to be free and that to be free means to be brave. Therefore do not take lightly the perils of war. Thucydides

The secret of happiness is freedom, and the secret of freedom, courage. Thucydides

Civil libertarians must often remind government officials (and others) that if the First Amendment only protected the expression of popular and agreeable ideas, it would be totally unnecessary since those ideas would never be threatened by our democratic form of government. Our society's commitment to free speech is tested when we encounter the expression of ideas that are disagreeable --- or even offensive. Timothy Lynch Director of Cato Institute's Project on Criminal Justice

No Gulag, evidently, can deter the advocates of state power from believing in their own virtue and in the morality of the power they exercise. We are all Hobbesians now. Virtue is presumed to reside in the state. Its reliance on compulsion is seen as fulfilling, no undermining, morality. Our communicators, oddly employed in the private sector, work tirelessly to ensure that state control is maintained, our taxes stay high, the official message is promoted. The people know, and can only know, a tiny fraction of what Leviathan does, and what they know is what these partisans tell them. Tom Bethel

If you think we are free today, you know nothing about tyranny and even less about freedom. Tom Braun

Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court. The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted. U.S. Constitution

No state shall ... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility. U.S. Constitution

The Congress shall have power: To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures; U.S. Constitution

We recognize, as appellants urge, the undisputed power of the jury to acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given by the judge, and contrary to the evidence. This is a power that must exist as long as we adhere to the general verdict in criminal cases, for the courts cannot search the minds of the jurors to find the basis upon which they judge. If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused, is unjust, or that exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic of passion, the jury has the power to acquit, and the courts must abide by that decision. U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Maryland

Since it was first recognized in \[the\] Magna Carta, trial by jury has been a prized shield against oppression ... U.S. Supreme Court

Lying can never save us from another lie. Vaclav Havel

Being tolerant does not mean that I share another one's belief. But it does mean that I acknowledge another one's right to believe, and obey, his own conscience. Viktor Frankl

The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore. Vincent van Gogh

Had the states been despoiled of their sovereignty by the generality of the preamble, and had the Federal Government been endowed with whatever they should judge to be instrumental towards the union, justice, tranquility, common defence, general welfare, and the preservation of liberty, nothing could have been more frivolous than an enumeration of powers. Virginia General Assembly

We can and must write in a language which sows among the masses hate, revulsion, and scorn toward those who disagree with us. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin

The way to crush the bourgeoisie is to grind them between the millstones of taxation and inflation. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin

It is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster. Voltaire

It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong. Voltaire

It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere. Voltaire

The ideal form of government is democracy tempered with assassination. Voltaire

Horse sense is the thing a horse has which keeps it from betting on people. W. C. Fields

It is the growing custom to narrow control, concentrate power, disregard and disfranchise the public; and assuming that certain powers by divine right of money-raising or by sheer assumption, have the power to do as they think best without consulting the wisdom of mankind. W. E. B. Du Bois

It is the growing custom to narrow control, concentrate power, disregard and disfranchise the public; and assuming that certain powers by divine right of money-raising or by sheer assumption, have the power to do as they think best without consulting the wisdom of mankind. W. E. B. Du Bois

The cost of liberty is less than the price of repression. W. E. B. Du Bois

Political history is far too criminal and pathological to be a fit subject of study for the young. Children should acquire their heroes and villains from fiction. W. H. Auden

One of the most insidious consequences of the present burden of personal income tax is that it strips many middle class families of financial reserves & seems to lend support to campaigns for socialized medicine, socialized housing, socialized food, socialized every thing. The personal income tax has made the individual vastly more dependent on the State & more avid for state hand-outs. It has shifted the balance in America from an individual-centered to a State-centered economic & social system. W. H. Chamberlin

Communism and socialism is *[sic]* seductive. It promises us that people will contribute according to ability and receive according to needs. Everybody is equal. Everybody has a right to decent housing, decent food and affordable medical care. History should have taught us that when we hear people talk this stuff --- watch out! Walter E. Williams

Democracy and liberty are not the same. Democracy is little more than mob rule, while liberty refers to the sovereignty of the individual. Walter E. Williams

When all think alike, no one is thinking very much. Walter Lippmann

Whereas each man claims his freedom as a matter of right, the freedom he accords to other men is a matter of toleration. Walter Lippmann

When men are brought face to face with their opponents, forced to listen and learn and mend their ideas, they cease to be children and savages and begin to live like civilized men. Then only is freedom a reality, when men may voice their opinions because they must examine their opinions. Walter Lippmann

Our lives improve only when we take chances --- and the first and most difficult risk we can take is to be honest with ourselves. Walter Truett Anderson

... \[O\]urs is a sick profession marked by incompetence, lack of training, misconduct and bad manners. Ineptness, bungling, malpractice, and bad ethics can be observed in court houses all over this country every day ... these incompetents have a seeming unawareness of the fundamental ethics of the profession. ... the harsh truth is that ... we may well be on our way to a society, overrun by hordes of lawyers, hungry as locusts, and brigades of judges in numbers never before contemplated. Warren E. Burger

No free people can lose their liberties while they are jealous of liberty. But the liberties of the freest people are in danger when they set up symbols of liberty as fetishes, worshipping the symbol instead of the principle it represents. Wendell Phillips

Whether in chains or in laurels, liberty knows nothing but victories. Wendell Phillips

After 20 years on the bench I have concluded that federal drug laws are a disaster. It is time to get the government out of drug enforcement. Whitman Knapp

We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but a habit. Will Durant

Liberty doesn't work as well in practice as it does in speeches. Will Rogers

Nothing makes a man, or a body of men, as mad as the truth. If there is no truth in it, they laugh it off. Will Rogers

Self-defense is a part of the law of nature; nor can it be denied the community, even against the king himself. William Barclay

And, lastly, to vindicate these rights, when actually violated and attacked, the subjects of England are entitled, in the first place, to the regular administration and free course of justice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the king and parliament for redress of grievances; and, lastly, to the right of having and using arms for self preservation and defense. William Blackstone

The public good is in nothing more essentially interested, than in the protection of every individual's private rights. William Blackstone

He is the freeman whom the truth makes free. William Cowper

'Tis liberty alone that gives the flower Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume; And we are weeds without it. William Cowper

A clique of US industrialists is hell-bent to bring a fascist state to supplant our democratic government and is working closely with the fascist regime in Germany and Italy. I have had plenty of opportunity in my post in Berlin to witness how close some of our American ruling families are to the Nazi regime. ... Certain American industrialists had a great deal to do with bringing fascist regimes into being in both Germany and Italy. They extended aid to help Fascism occupy the seat of power, and they are helping to keep it there. William E. Dodd

Knowledge is essential to freedom. William Ellery Channing

Progress, the growth of power, is the end and boon of liberty; and, without this, a people may have the name, but want the substance and spirit of freedom. William Ellery Channing

The only freedom worth possessing is that which gives enlargement to a people's energy, intellect, and virtues. William Ellery Channing

The spirit of liberty is not merely, as multitudes imagine, a jealousy of our own particular rights, but a respect for the rights of others, and an unwillingness that any man, whether high or low, should be wronged and trampled under foot. William Ellery Channing

Marijuana is not much more difficult to obtain than beer. The reason for this is that a liquor store selling beer to a minor stands to lose its liquor license. Marijuana salesmen don't have expensive overheads, and so are not easily punished. William F. Buckley Jr.

We cannot choose freedom established on a hierarchy of degrees of freedom, on a caste system of equality like military rank. We must be free not because we claim freedom, but because we practice it. William Faulkner

The type and formula of most schemes of philanthropy or humanitarianism is this: A and B put their heads together to decide what C shall be made to do for D. The radical vice of all these schemes, from a sociological point of view, is that C is not allowed a voice in the matter, and his position, character, and interests, as well as the ultimate effects on society through C's interests, are entirely overlooked. I call C [the Forgotten Man]({% post_url 2009-11-23-the-forgotten-man %}). William Graham Sumner

The greatest Glory of a free-born People, Is to transmit that Freedom to their Children. William Havard

The only vice that can not be forgiven is hypocrisy. William Hazlitt

All ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance --- unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion, have the full protection of the guarantees \[of the First Amendment\]. William J. Brennan

If there is a bedrock principle of the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable. William J. Brennan

If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable. William J. Brennan

The concept of military necessity is seductively broad, and has a dangerous plasticity. Because they invariably have the visage of overriding importance, there is always a temptation to invoke security 'necessities' to justify an encroachment upon civil liberties. For that reason, the military-security argument must be approached with a healthy skepticism. William J. Brennan

The first thing to learn in intercourse with others is non-interference with their own particular ways of being happy, provided those ways do not assume to interfere by violence with ours. William James

Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system, another body representing another form of government, a bureaucratic elite which believes our Constitution is outmoded. William Jenner

Enslave the liberty of but one human being and the liberties of the world are put in peril. William Lloyd Garrison


Freedom of movement is the very essence of our free society --- once the right to travel is curtailed, all other rights suffer. William O. Douglas

Restriction of free thought and free speech is the most dangerous of all subversions. It is the one un-American act that could most easily defeat us. William O. Douglas

If ... our bureaucratic masters are becoming more akin to Soviet-style or Eastern European counterparts, it was rarely seen as a plus that those central schemers had wonderful intentions with their five-year plans. Such goals as 'job safety,' 'equality,' and freedom from 'discrimination,' depending on their definitions, may be good things for society, but they were never intended to be the business of the federal government. William P. Hoar

The bank hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing. William Paterson

Let the people think they govern and they will be governed. William Penn


His ignorance is encyclopedic. Abba Eban

If a man does his best, what else is there? George S. Patton

Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted. Albert Einstein

Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former. Albert Einstein

I have often thought that nothing would do more extensive good at small expense than the establishment of a small circulating library in every county, to consist of a few well-chosen books, to be lent to the people of the country under regulations as would secure their safe return in due time. Thomas Jefferson

I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson

Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear ... Do not be frightened from this inquiry from any fear of its consequences. If it ends in the belief that there is no God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you feel in its exercise ... Thomas Jefferson

The error seems not sufficiently eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are subject to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have authority over such natural rights only as we have submitted to them. The rights of conscience we never submitted, we could not submit. We are answerable for them to our God. The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others ... Was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now. Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as a medicine, and the potatoe as an article of food. Thomas Jefferson

When the same man, or set of men, holds the sword and the purse, there is an end of liberty. George Mason



We recognize the force of the argument that the effects of war under modern conditions may be felt in the economy for years and years, and that if the war power can be used in days of peace to treat all the wounds which war inflicts on our society, it may not only swallow up all other powers of Congress but largely obliterate the Ninth and the Tenth Amendments as well. William O. Douglas



The blame for \[the national debt\] lies with the Congress and the President, with Democrats and Republicans alike, most all of whom have been unwilling to make the hard choices or to explain to the American people that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Warren Rudman


An economy cannot long remain prosperous by government's taxing and spending more, now absorbing national output at a rate equal to the entire income of every American living west of the Mississippi. If this trend continues, America will gradually sink into the status of a Third World nation --- more unemployment, more shackles on production, more poverty. John Hospers



As a rule, panics do not destroy capital; they merely reveal the extent to which it has been destroyed by its betrayal into hopelessly unproductive works. John Mills



With the monetary system we have now, the careful saving of a lifetime can be wiped out in an eyeblink. Larry Parks



Today government touches everything in America and harms almost everything it touches. Federal, state, and local governments together spend 42 out of every 100 dollars we earn. Those who do the taxing and spending have long since ceased to work for the people as a whole. Rather, they work for themselves and for their clients—the education industry, the welfare culture, public-employee unions, etc. Malcolm Wallop



If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there'd be a shortage of sand. Milton Friedman


I am for a government rigorously frugal and simple. Were we directed from Washington when to sow, when to reap, we should soon want bread. Thomas Jefferson


He that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing. Benjamin Franklin


No one spends someone else's money as carefully as he spends his own. Mark Skousen



A depression is a large-scale decline in production and trade ... there is nothing in the nature of a free-market economy to cause such an event. Nathaniel Branden



Why be thrifty when your old age and health care are provided for, no matter how profligate you act in your youth? Why be prudent when the state insures your bank deposits, replaces your flooded-out house, buys all the wheat you can grow? ... Why be diligent when half of your earnings are taken from you and given to the idle? David Frum


Welfarism and excessive spending and deficits and socialism divide us, because everybody has to go to Washington. Those who have the biggest clout, those who are the best lobbyists, those who go and they grab. And whether it's the medical industrial complex, or the banking industry, or the military industrial complex, that's who ends up controlling our government ... For so long, conservatives and constitutionalists have lost the argument, they lost the moral high ground. Because those who want to give things away, not talking about where they steal it from, but they want to give things and take care of people, they get the moral high ground and they come by as being compassionate. And we who believe in liberty, we lack compassion. But the truth is, there's only one compassionate system known to man, and that is freedom and personal responsibility, then there's enough wealth, and then we will all have personal responsibility to use this compassion that we have, first to take care of our families and friends and neighbors, and there would be so much wealth that we could spread this wealth around the world. Ron Paul


The best way to put more money in people's wallets is to leave it there in the first place. Edwin Feulner



Spending by government currently amounts to about 45 percent of national income. By that test, government owns 45 percent of the means of production that produce the national income. The U.S. is now 45 percent socialist. Milton Friedman


In 1983 $21 billion was spent in agricultural subsidies --- almost equal to the net income of all American farmers. Patrick Detches


It would take little more than $50 billion to raise every poor person above the official poverty line, yet the percentage of the population classified as poor hardly budges, while annual welfare spending amounts to four times that much. Where's the money going? Robert Higgs


The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left. Ecclesiastes


Without the confidence factor, many believe a paper money system is liable to collapse eventually. Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia


The banks --- commercial banks and the Federal Reserve --- create all the money of this nation and its people pay interest on every dollar of that newly created money. Which means that private banks exercise unconstitutionally, immorally, and ridiculously the power to tax the people. For every newly created dollar dilutes to some extent the value of every other dollar already in circulation. Jerry Voorhis



Inflation is a quiet but effective way for the government to transfer resources from the people to itself, without raising taxes. A hundred-dollar bill would buy less in 1998 than a $20 bill would buy in the 1960s. This means that anyone who kept his money in a safe over those years would have lost 80 percent of its value, because no safe can keep your money safe from politicians who control the printing presses. Thomas Sowell


Joe Biden is spiritually, mentally, physically, and socially retarded. Ted Nugent


Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must come first, without question. Donald J. Trump



I hope we never find life on another planet because if we do there's no doubt that the United States will start sending them money! Donald J. Trump



Hundreds of thousands of rouble notes are being issued daily by our treasury. This is done, not in order to fill the coffers of the State with practically worthless paper, but with the deliberate intention of destroying the value of money as a means of payment. ... Experience has taught us it is impossible to root out the evils of capitalism merely by conﬁscation and expropriation… The simplest way to exterminate the very spirit of capitalism is therefore to ﬂood the country with notes of a high face-value without financial guarantees of any sort. ... \[T\]he great illusion of the value and power of money, on which the capitalist state is based will have been definitely destroyed. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin



The Latin American drug cartels have stretched their tentacles much deeper into our lives than most people believe. It's possible they are calling the shots at all levels of government. William Colby


All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible. Frank Herbert

Fascist intellectuals, such as Ugo Spirito, made the round of conferences preaching the virtues of post-capitalism fascism and in fact tried to nudge the structure in a "leftist" direction by calling for more collective control and even corporative ownership of the economy. Mussolini looked abroad to find that Franklin Roosevelt was merely seeking to emulate Italy's innovations. Charles S. Maier



We've been asleep for about 50 years. Ever since the end of World War II we just steadily handed our future and our bank accounts and now our children, handed them all over to the federal government ... Michael Moriarty

No man's life, liberty or property are safe while the legislature is in session. Gideon J. Tucker

The crucial distinction between systems ... was no longer ideological. The main political difference was between those who did, and those who did not, believe that the citizen could --- or should --- be the property of the state. Christopher Hitchens

Your understanding and consent are not required for someone to take your life, kill your loved ones, and destroy all you hold dear. William April

\[A\] deep-rooted culture of incompetence and corruption has made it virtually impossible for government to function fairly and efficiently. And because most government employees are shielded by layers of protection, they couldn't care less. Never before in the history of this nation has there been a greater divide between a self-serving federal leviathan and millions of Americans ... 'Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem,' Ronald Reagan reminded us during his inaugural address in 1981. Nothing's changed since then, with one exception: It's gotten far worse. Arnold Ahlert

The real reason to abolish departments like Energy and Education is not to promote efficiency, nor even to save taxpayers' money. It is that many agencies perform functions that are not Federal responsibility. The founders delegated to the Government only strictly defined authority in Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution. Search the entire Constitution, and you will find no authorization for Congress to subsidize the arts, finance and regulate education, or invest tax revenues in energy research. David Boaz

Since the State necessarily lives by the compulsory confiscation of private capital, and since its expansion necessarily involves ever-greater incursions on private individuals and private enterprise, we must assert that the state is profoundly and inherently anti-capitalist. Murray N. Rothbard

To own firearms is to affirm that freedom and liberty are not gifts from the state. It is to reserve final judgment about whether the state is encroaching on freedom and liberty, to stand ready to defend that freedom with more than mere words, and to stand outside the state's totalitarian reach. Jeffrey R. Snyder

The state calls its own violence law, but that of the individual crime. Max Stirner

In America it is the so-called capitalist who is to blame for the fulfillment of Marx's prophecies. Beguiled by the state's siren song of special privilege, the capitalists have abandoned capitalism. Frank Chodorov

What, actually, is the difference between communism and fascism? Both are forms of statism, authoritarianism. The only difference between Stalin's communism and Mussolini's fascism is an insignificant detail in organizational structure. Leonard E. Read

The Radical Centre seem to have the same obsession with control that the fascists and communists had, but unlike them, it is control for control's sake rather than in the service of some clear ideology ... They do not seek the triumph of Volk or the dictatorship of the proletariat, they just seek to replace all social interactions with politically mediated interactions. They seek to regulate everything via a total state that ... just wants a world in which nothing whatsoever is private, everything is political. Their symbol is not the Hammer and Sickle or the Swastika, it is the CCTV camera. Perry de Havilland

We should ... be able to see that our interest would be best served not by asking the state to promulgate our values but by forbidding the state to promulgate any values at all. If the state can espouse some value that we love, it can, with equal justice, espouse others we do not love. Richard Mitchell

When any government, or any church for that matter, undertakes to say to its subjects, "This you may not read, this you may not see, this you are forbidden to know," the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy the motives. Mighty little force is needed to control a man whose mind has been hoodwinked; contrariwise, no amount of force can control a free man, a man whose mind is free. No, not the rack, not fission bombs, not anything --- you can't conquer a free man; the most you can do is kill him. Robert A. Heinlein

COLLECTIVISM: Collectivism is defined as the theory and practice that makes some sort of group rather than the individual the fundamental unit of political, social, and economic concern. In theory, collectivists insist that the claims of groups, associations, or the state must normally supersede the claims of individuals. Stephen Grabill

It is hard to imagine a more stupid or more dangerous way of making decisions than by putting those decisions in the hands of people who pay no price for being wrong. Thomas Sowell

In existing criminology there are concepts: a criminal man, a criminal profession, a criminal society, a criminal sect, and a criminal tribe, but there is no concept of a criminal state, or a criminal government, or criminal legislation. Consequently, the biggest crimes actually escape being called crimes. P. D. Ouspensky

We only pass laws against people who obey the law. Drug dealers, bank robbers and rapists don't care what we do because they willfully violate the law anyway. Rod Wright

If someone enters your house, they are making that conscious decision. They are there to steal from you or hurt you in other ways. You have that right to protect yourself and use deadly force. Nate Bible

The only purpose for which power can be righttully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. John Stuart Mill

We don't have inflation because the people are living too well. We have inflation because the Government is living too well. Ronald Reagan

Our survival, the future of our civilization, possibly the existence of mankind, depends on American leadership. Charles Lindbergh

People keep looking to government for the answer and government is the problem. Ronald Reagan

If liberty is worth keeping and free representative government worth saving, we must stand for all American fundamentals --- not some, but all. All are woven into the great fabric of our national well-being. We cannot hold fast to some only, and abandon others that, for the moment, we find inconvenient. If one American fundamental is prostrated, others in the end will surely fall. Albert J. Beveridge

Man will ultimately be governed by God or by tyrants. Benjamin Franklin

If we abide by the principles taught in the Bible, our country will go on prospering. Daniel Webster

Good government generally begins in the family, and if the moral character of a people once degenerate, their political character must soon follow. Elias Boudinot

The Americans of 1776 were among the first men in modern society to defend rather than to seek an open society and constitutional liberty. ... Perhaps the most remarkable characteristic of this political theory sits in its deep-seated conservatism. However radical the principles of the Revolution may have seemed to the rest of the world, in the minds of the colonists they were thoroughly preservative and respectful of the past. Clinton Lawrence Rossiter III

The people of the U.S. owe their Independence & their liberty, to the wisdom of descrying in the minute tax of 3 pence on tea, the magnitude of the evil comprised in the precedent. Let them exert the same wisdom, in watching against every evil lurking under plausible disguises, and growing up from small beginnings. James Madison

America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves. Abraham Lincoln

The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government. Constitution for the United States, Art. IV, 1789

The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. Edward Bernays

Too many Americans have twisted the sensible right to pursue happiness into the delusion that we are entitled to a guarantee of happiness. If we don't get exactly what we want, we assume someone must be violating our rights. We're no longer willing to write off some of life's disappointments to simple bad luck. Susan Jacoby

What we need to do in this country is make sure the majority of the American people really want their freedoms back again,  We have to have people once again believe in liberty, foreign policy that defends America, but is not the policeman of the world. We don't have the right nor the facilities to throw our weight around and tell the rest of the world how to live. Ron Paul

If all that Americans want is security, they can go to prison. They'll have enough to eat, a bed and a roof over their heads. But if an American wants to preserve his dignity and his equality as a human being, he must not bow his neck to any dictatorial government Dwight D. Eisenhower

An able, disinterested, public-spirited press, with trained intelligence to know the right and courage to do it, can preserve that public virtue without which popular government is a sham and a mockery. A cynical, mercenary, demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself. Joseph Pulitzer

In the United States there is no phenomenon more threatening to popular government than the unwillingness of newspapers to give the facts to their readers. Nelson Antrim Crawford

Liberty without virtue would be no blessing to us. Dr. Benjamin Rush

In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happened, you can bet it was planned that way. Franklin D. Roosevelt

I believe that if the people of this nation fully understood what Congress has done to them over the last 49 years, they would move on Washington; they would not wait for an election... It adds up to a preconceived plan to destroy the economic and social independence of the United States! George W. Malone

The lesson that Americans today have forgotten or never learned --- the lesson which our ancestors tried so hard to teach -- is that the greatest threat to our lives, liberty, property, and security is not some foreign government, as our rulers so often tell us. The greatest threat to our freedom and well-being lies with our own government!. Jacob G. Hornberger

Whenever the legislators endeavour to take away, and destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power, they put themselves into a state of war with the people, who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience, and are left to the common refuge, which God hath provided for all men, against force and violence. Whensoever therefore the legislative shall transgress this fundamental rule of society; and either by ambition, fear, folly or corruption, endeavour to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other, an absolute power over the lives, liberties, and estates of the people; by this breach of trust they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the people, who have a right to resume their original liberty ... John Locke

The enormous gap between what U.S. leaders do in the world and what Americans think their leaders are doing is one of the great propaganda accomplishments of the dominant political mythology. Michael Parenti

Freedom has its life in the hearts, the actions, the spirit of men and so it must be daily earned and refreshed --- else like a flower cut from its life-giving roots, it will wither and die. Dwight D. Eisenhower

I apprehend no danger to our country from a foreign foe ... Our destruction, should it come at all, will be from another quarter. --- From the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government, from their carelessness and negligence, I must confess that I do apprehend some danger. I fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants, and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct; that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men, and become the instruments of their own undoing. Make them intelligent, and they will be vigilant; give them the means of detecting the wrong, and they will apply the remedy. Daniel Webster

But you must remember, my fellow-citizens, that eternal vigilance by the people is the price of liberty, and that you must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing. Andrew Jackson

In the struggle between those seeking power there is no middle course. Cornelius Tacitus

Communism works only in heaven, where they don't need it, and in hell, where they already have it. Ronald Reagan

A wholesome regard for the memory of the great men of long ago is the best assurance to a people of a continuation of great men to come, who shall be able to instruct, to lead, and to inspire. A people who worship at the shrine of true greatness will themselves be truly great. Calvin Coolidge

As nightfall does not come all at once, neither does oppression. In both instances, there is a twilight when everything remains seemingly unchanged. And it is in such twilight that we all must be most aware of change in the air --- however slight --- lest we become unwitting victims of the darkness. William O. Douglas

I want to make one thing clear. This war against our constitution is not being fought way off in Madagascar or in Mandalay. It is being fought here --- in our schools, our colleges, our churches, our women's clubs. It is being fought with our money, channeled through the State Department. It is being fought twenty-four hours a day --- while we remain asleep. How many of you Senators know what the UN is doing to change the teaching of the children in your own home town? The UN is at work there, every day and night, changing the teachers, changing the teaching materials, changing the very words and tones --- changing all the essential ideas which we imagine our schools are teaching to our young folks. How in the name of Heaven are we to sit here, approve these programs, appropriate our own people's money --- for such outrageous "orientation" of our own children, and of the men and women who teach our children, in this Nation's schools? William Jenner

How prone all human institutions have been to decay; how subject the best-formed and most wisely organized governments have been to lose their check and totally dissolve; how difficult it has been for mankind, in all ages and countries, to preserve their dearest rights and best privileges, impelled as it were by an irresistible fate of despotism. James Monroe

It is a great importance to set a resolution, not to be shaken, never to tell an untruth. There is no vice so mean, so pitiful, so contemptible and he who permits himself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second and third time, till at length it becomes habitual, he tells lies without attending to it, and truths without the world's believing him. This falsehood of the tongue leads to that of the heart, and in time depraves all it's good dispositions. Thomas Jefferson

Let the Constitution be taught in schools, seminaries, and in colleges; let it be written in primers, in spelling books, and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, enforced in courts of justice. In short, let it become the political religion of the nation. Abraham Lincoln

Debate, it seems to me, is one of the most useful of human inventions. It is the mother and father of all free inquiry and honest thought. It tests ideas, detects errors and promotes clear thinking. A man cannot stand up before it without exposing his whole intellectual stock of goods. H. L. Mencken

The penalty good men pay for indifference to public affairs, is to be ruled by evil men. Plato

The Constitution shall never be construed…to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms. Samuel Adams

Arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and the plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property. The same balance would be preserved were all the world destitute of arms, for all would be alike; but since some will not, others dare not lay them aside ... Horrid mischief would ensue were one half the world deprived of the use of them. Thomas Paine

To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them. Richard Henry Lee

The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. Noah Webster

What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. Thomas Jefferson

The ideology underlying all forms of American resistance to British usurpations and infringements was explicitly premised on the right of self-defense of all inalienable rights. From the self-defense foundation was constructed a political theory in which the people were the masters and government the servant, so that the people have the right to remove a disobedient servant. The philosophy was not novel but was directly derived from political and legal philosophers such as John Locke, Hugo Grotius, and Edward Coke. David Kopel

A Gun Grabber–to-English Dictionary

Here's a handy phrasebook that translates the gun grabbers' favorite clichés into everyday, honest English.

Assault rifle = Any rifle with features that look scary to a liberal.

Common-sense gun law = Any law the gun grabbers want to pass to restrict or remove your constitutional right to bear arms.

Conversation = "Let's have a conversation about guns" means, "Let's agree to do it my way."

Compromise = "After we have a conversation over wine, we will reach a compromise where you agree to give up your gun rights."

Family fire = What happens when people are too nutty or too stupid, or both, to have guns in the home.

Firearm death rate = A misleading statistic that conflates homicides with suicides; the number is then "age adjusted" to make it totally useless. The goal is to make gun-friendly states, like Vermont and New Hampshire, appear more dangerous than pro-gun control states like New Jersey, which has high violent crime areas, such as Camden and Newark.

Firearm suicide rate = A statistic used to distract people from the real cause of suicide and to blame the gun, even though many countries "with restrictive gun laws have higher suicide rates than the United States does.

Gun-free zone = A kill zone; a place that tells criminals, terrorists, and psychopaths, "Come and get us." The areas where 97 percent of the mass shootings since 1950 have occurred.

Gun lobby = The six million lawful gun owners who are the dues-paying members of the NRA.

Gun safety = What the left used to call "gun control," which was itself a euphemism. The real goal in either case is gun prohibition.

Gun-show loophole = A term used to obfuscate where illegal guns come from and how to stop them. The term really refers to the right to sell your own property without first getting the government's permission.

Gun violence = A free-floating abstraction to justify restrictions on guns and gun rights, ignoring the criminals and terrorists responsible for most of the violence. Usually paired with totally misleading statistics that mix suicides by gunshot together with (much less frequent) violent acts involving guns.

High-capacity magazines = Any magazine larger than what Michael Bloomberg or Governor Andrew Cuomo thinks you ought to have. Also, the standard magazine that police, game wardens, and th. Department of Homeland Security carry for personal defense—and they carry multiples of them.

"I support the Second Amendment" = "I support your right to own a Revolutionary War musket but hate your right to keep and bear modern arms developed many decades ago. Besides, the Second Amendment applies only to the militia, like the National Guard."

Red flag laws = Laws that allow an angry neighbor or an angry ex-spouse to have your guns seized without due process or remedy.

Safe-storage laws = Laws that ensure that you can't access your guns if you need them in an emergency. A better name for these laws would be the Turning Your Firearm into a Hammer laws.

Universal background checks = Laws prohibiting your right to sell your own property without first getting the government's permission.

"Weapon of war = Any rifle that looks scary to a liberal, whether it has ever been used in a war or not.

"We don't want to take away your guns" = "We want to take away your guns." Mark W. Smith, *First They Came for the Gun Owners: The Campaign to Disarm You and Take Your Freedoms*

if you love the First Amendment, you'd better cherish the Second. Mark W. Smith
