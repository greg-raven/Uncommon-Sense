Positive laws are tyrannical. One's individual rights --- whether they be life, liberty, or property --- must be sacrificed by the state in order to fulfill the positive rights of another. For example, if housing is considered a "right," then the state will have to confiscate wealth (property) from those who have provided shelter for themselves in order to house those who have not ... True justice is realized when our lives, and property are secure, and we are free to express our thoughts without fear of retribution. Just laws are negative in nature; they exist to thwart the violation of our natural rights. Government ought to be the collective organization --- that is, the extension --- of the individual's right of self-defense, and its purpose to protect our lives, liberties, and property.
