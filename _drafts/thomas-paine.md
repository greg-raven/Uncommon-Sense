Government ought to be as much open to improvement as anything which appertains to man, instead of which it has been monopolized from age to age, by the most ignorant and vicious of the human race. Need we any other proof of their wretched management, than the excess of debts and taxes with which every nation groans, and the quarrels into which they have precipitated the world?

The trade of governing has always been monopolized by the most ignorant and the most rascally individuals of mankind.

Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it.

Though the flame of liberty may sometimes cease to shine, the coal can never expire.

When I contemplate the natural dignity of man; when I feel … for the honor and happiness of its character, I become irritated at the attempt to govern mankind by force and fraud, as if they were all knaves and fools, and can scarcely avoid disgust at those who are thus imposed upon.
